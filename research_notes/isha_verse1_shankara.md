## Sanskrit (Devanagari)
ईशा वास्यम् इदं सर्वं यत् किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।
तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्य स्विद्धनम् ॥ १ ॥

## Sanskrit (IAST)
īśā vāsyam idaṃ sarvaṃ yat kiñca jagatyāṃ jagat |
tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā mā gṛdhaḥ kasya sviddhanam || 1 ||

## Translation
1. In the Lord is to be veiled all this—whatsoever moves on earth. Through such renunciation do thou save (thyself); be not covetous of any one's wealth.

## Key Points from Shankara's Commentary
- This verse establishes the fundamental teaching of the Upanishad
- The entire visible universe is to be considered as clothed, covered, or inhabited by the Lord (Isha)
- Emphasizes renunciation (tyakta) as the path to liberation
- Warns against covetousness and attachment to wealth
- Foundation for the path of Jnana (knowledge)

## Notes
- This is verse 1 of the Kanva recension (18 verses total)
- Shankara's commentary focuses on non-dualism (Advaita)
- The verse sets the tone for the entire Upanishad's teaching
