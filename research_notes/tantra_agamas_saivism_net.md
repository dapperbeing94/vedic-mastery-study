# Tantra & Agamas - Saivism.net Research Notes

**Source**: https://www.saivism.net/articles/agamas.asp

## Significance in Saivism

- In Saivism, **Agamas have as much significance as the Vedas, if not more**
- Foundation of Shaiva, Tantra, and Shakta traditions since earliest times
- Shaivas may not necessarily believe in the Vedas, but they do in the sanctity and authority of the Agamas
- **Unlike the Vedas, the Agamas are meant for all castes and sections of society, including women**

## Etymology and Definition

- **Agama** means "authoritative scripture"
- Used by Panini (Sanskrit grammarian) as a linguistic term
- Tantric and Saiva tradition recognizes agamas as the most authoritative texts on worshipping Saguna Iswara (Brahman with qualities)

## Agama vs. Nigama

- **Agamas**: Teachings by Lord Siva to His consort Parvathi
- **Nigamas**: Parvathi as teacher, Siva as recipient
- According to Tantric tradition, **the Vedas are nigamas**

## Historical Debate

**Three Competing Theories**:

1. **Later Vedic Period Theory**: Earliest Agamas composed during later Vedic period when Vedic rituals were declining
2. **Pre-Vedic Theory**: Some believe earliest agamas are much older than the Vedas
3. **Agamic Origins Theory**: Some Upanishads and portions of Bhagavad Gita were renditions of preexisting agamas

**Follower Perspective**: Followers of Siva consider these texts **superior to the Vedas**
