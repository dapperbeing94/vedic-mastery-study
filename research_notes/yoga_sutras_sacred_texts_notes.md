**1.33** - By cultivating friendliness towards happiness and compassion towards misery, gladness towards virtue and indifference towards vice, the mind becomes pure.

## Key Sutras from Chapter 2 (Sadhana Pada)

**2.1** - Austerity, the study of sacred texts, and the dedication of action to God constitute the discipline of Mystic Union.

**2.3** - The five afflictions are ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life.

**2.5** - Ignorance is taking the non-eternal for the eternal, the impure for the pure, evil for good and non-self as self.

**2.28** - On the destruction of impurity by the sustained practice of the limbs of Union, the light of knowledge reveals the faculty of discrimination.
