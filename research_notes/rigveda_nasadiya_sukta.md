## HYMN CXXIX. Creation.

**Verse 1**
> THEN was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no sky beyond it.
> What covered in, and where? and what gave shelter? Was water there, unfathomed depth of water?

**Verse 2**
> Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there, the day's and night's divider.
> That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.

**Verse 3**
> Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos.
> All that existed then was void and form less: by the great power of Warmth was born that Unit.

**Verse 4**
> Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit.
> Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent.

**Verse 5**
> Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it then, and what below it?
> There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here and energy up yonder

**Verse 6**
> Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation?
> The Gods are later than this world's production. Who knows then whence it first came into being?

**Verse 7**
> He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it,
> Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not.

## Significance

This is one of the most profound philosophical hymns in the Rigveda, expressing:
- **Cosmological speculation** about the origin of the universe
- **Epistemological humility** - even the gods don't know, perhaps even the creator doesn't know
- **Non-dualistic thinking** - the existent's kinship in the non-existent
- **Primordial unity** - "That One Thing" before differentiation
- **Desire (Kama)** as the first movement toward creation

This hymn is frequently cited as evidence of sophisticated philosophical thinking in the earliest Vedic period.
