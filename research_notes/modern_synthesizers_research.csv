Swami Vivekananda - 19th century Hindu monk who introduced Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,Swami Vivekananda,"Born Narendranath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bengal Presidency, British India. He was the chief disciple of the 19th-century mystic Ramakrishna. His most significant life event was his address at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, which introduced Hinduism to the Western world. He traveled extensively, establishing the Vedanta Societies before his death on July 4, 1902.","Vivekananda's philosophy is rooted in **Advaita Vedanta**, which he made accessible through his concept of **Practical Vedanta**, applying the highest truths of the Upanishads to daily life and social service. His core teachings include the **Divinity of the Soul** (that every soul is potentially divine and the goal of life is to manifest this divinity) and the principle of **Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva** (""Service to Man is Service to God""), which emphasizes social service and humanitarian work as a practical form of spiritual discipline. He systematized and popularized the four paths to spiritual realization: **Karma Yoga** (selfless action), **Bhakti Yoga** (devotion), **Raja Yoga** (mental control), and **Jnana Yoga** (knowledge).","His major works are primarily compilations of his lectures and discourses, which were transcribed and published. These include *Raja Yoga* (1896), *Karma Yoga*, *Bhakti Yoga*, *Jnana Yoga*, and *My Master*. His complete body of work is compiled in *The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda* (a multi-volume collection).","He founded the **Ramakrishna Mission** in 1897, a philanthropic and spiritual organization dedicated to social service, healthcare, and education, with the motto *Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Cha* (""For one's own salvation, and for the good of the world""). He also established the **Ramakrishna Math**, the monastic order associated with the Mission. Furthermore, he founded the first **Vedanta Society** in New York in 1894, and subsequently in other major Western cities, to propagate the universal teachings of Vedanta.","Vivekananda is considered a key figure in the Hindu reform movement, providing a modern, rational, and assertive interpretation of Hinduism that infused the tradition with a spirit of nationalism and social responsibility. Globally, he was the first Hindu spiritual leader to successfully introduce Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, particularly through his address at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. His efforts led to the widespread acceptance of Yoga and meditation in the West and established Hinduism as a major world religion.","His key concepts and innovations include **Practical Vedanta**, which applies Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic principles to ethical and social life, emphasizing the inherent divinity in all beings and the need for selfless service. He championed **Man-Making Education**, an educational philosophy centered on the idea that ""Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man,"" aimed at the harmonious development of the body, mind, and soul. He also promoted the idea of a **Universal Religion**, asserting that all religions are different paths leading to the same ultimate goal, thereby promoting religious harmony and tolerance.","His teachings remain highly relevant for their emphasis on self-reliance, character-building, social service, and the synthesis of science and spirituality. His message of ""Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached"" is a powerful call to action for personal and national development. The Ramakrishna Math and Mission, with its numerous centers worldwide, continues to be the primary vehicle for his teachings. He is revered as a national hero and spiritual icon in India, and his philosophy influences countless individuals, spiritual seekers, and organizations globally, including many in the fields of self-help and motivational speaking.",
"Sri Aurobindo - philosopher, yogi, and poet who developed Integral Yoga and wrote The Life Divine",Sri Aurobindo,"Born August 15, 1872, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India; Died December 5, 1950, in Pondicherry (now Puducherry). He was educated in England at St. Paul’s School, London, and the University of Cambridge, where he became proficient in classical and modern European languages. After returning to India in 1893, he held administrative and professorial posts in Baroda before becoming a prominent figure in the Indian Independence Movement (1902-1910). A spiritual transformation while imprisoned led him to retire to Pondicherry in 1910 to dedicate his life to the practice and development of Integral Yoga.","Sri Aurobindo's core philosophical teaching is the **Integral Yoga**, a holistic path aiming for a divine life on Earth through spiritual evolution. He rejected the traditional Indian goal of *moksha* (individual liberation) as the sole end, positing that the true goal of creation is the transformation of terrestrial life itself in its higher evolutionary stages. His philosophy is a grand synthesis of diverse spiritual paths (Jnana, Bhakti, Karma Yoga) and traditional Hindu philosophy with modern thought, seeking to integrate the Spirit and Matter. This synthesis is detailed in his magnum opus, *The Life Divine*.","His major works include the philosophical treatise *The Life Divine* (1939), the poetic epic *Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol* (1950), and the practical guide *The Synthesis of Yoga* (1948). Other significant publications are *Essays on the Gita* (1922), *The Human Cycle* (1949), *The Ideal of Human Unity* (1949), and *On the Veda* (1956).","The primary organization is the **Sri Aurobindo Ashram**, founded in Pondicherry in 1926, which serves as the spiritual center of the movement. His spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (""The Mother""), founded **Auroville** (The City of Dawn) in 1968 as an international township dedicated to realizing his vision of human unity and a supramentalized life on Earth. The **Sri Aurobindo Society** is a worldwide non-governmental organization that promotes his vision and work.","Sri Aurobindo's philosophy has had a profound impact on modern Hinduism and global spirituality. He spearheaded a **Hindu Renaissance** by advocating for a return to the profound spiritual and psychological truths of the Vedas, providing a new, mystic interpretation that rejected purely ritualistic readings. Globally, his emphasis on the **Supramental Manifestation upon Earth** and the transformation of the collective ""Earth Consciousness"" represents a major shift in spiritual thought, moving the focus from world-rejection to world-affirmation and transformation. His work influenced fields like psychology, education, and political thought, promoting a vision of human unity and spiritualized society.","The central innovation is the concept of the **Supermind (Supramental Consciousness)**, which he describes as the dynamic manifestation of the Absolute and the intermediary power between the ultimate Spirit and the lower creation (Mind, Life, Matter). The Supermind's descent is the key to the final transformation. This transformation is achieved through the **Triple Transformation** of the being: 1) **Psychicization** (turning the outer being toward the inner soul), 2) **Spiritualization** (ascent to and descent from higher planes of consciousness), and 3) **Supramentalization** (the final, complete transformation by the Supermind). He also profoundly reinterpreted the **Veda** as a record of mystic and psychological knowledge.","Sri Aurobindo's vision of **Integral Consciousness** and the spiritual evolution of humanity remains highly relevant today, offering a holistic framework for addressing contemporary global challenges. His philosophy is seen as a bridge between Eastern spirituality and Western science. His teachings are followed by a global community of practitioners of Integral Yoga, and his works are studied in academic and spiritual circles worldwide. The movement continues to thrive through the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and the international township of Auroville.",
"S. Radhakrishnan - philosopher, statesman, and author of Indian Philosophy",S. Radhakrishnan,"Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born on 5 September 1888, in Tirutani, Madras Presidency, British India (now in Tamil Nadu). He was educated at Madras Christian College, where he wrote his M.A. thesis on *The Ethics of the Vedanta*, which was intended as a reply to the charge that the Vedanta system had no room for ethics. His academic career included professorships at the University of Mysore (1918–21) and the prestigious George V Chair of Philosophy at the University of Calcutta (1921–31). He was knighted in 1931. His political career began with his appointment as Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1949–1952), followed by his service as the first Vice-President of India (1952–1962) and the second President of India (1962–1967). He died on 17 April 1975, in Madras.","Radhakrishnan's core philosophical teaching is a reinterpretation and defense of **Advaita Vedanta** (non-dualism) for the modern world. He sought to present Hinduism as a rational, ethically sound, and universal religion, a ""religion of the Spirit."" He is considered a ""bridge-builder"" between Eastern and Western philosophical traditions, drawing from both to create a coherent system. He reinterpreted the concept of *maya* not as strict illusion (as in some interpretations of Shankara), but as a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real, while still recognizing the reality and diversity of the world (*prakṛti*) as having its origin and support in the Absolute (*Brahman*). His philosophy is a form of metaphysical idealism that preserves the notion of a wholly transcendent Absolute that is identical to the self (*Atman*).","Radhakrishnan was a prolific author. His major works include:
*   *Indian Philosophy* (Volume 1, 1923; Volume 2, 1927): A monumental survey of Indian thought.
*   *The Hindu View of Life* (1927): Based on his Upton Lectures at Oxford, it is a concise defense of Hinduism.
*   *An Idealist View of Life* (1932): Based on his Hibbert Lectures, considered his most sustained non-commentarial work.
*   *The Principal Upaniṣads* (1953): A translation and commentary.
*   *The Bhagavadgita* (1948): A translation and commentary.
*   *Brahma Sutra* (1959): A translation and commentary.
*   *East and West in Religion* (1933).","Radhakrishnan's career was marked by leadership in numerous academic and international organizations, though he did not primarily found religious organizations. Key roles include:
*   **University Education Commission (India)**: Served as Chairman (1948–1949), producing a foundational report for post-independence higher education.
*   **Benares Hindu University (BHU)**: Served as Vice-Chancellor (1939–1948).
*   **Andhra University**: Served as Vice-Chancellor (1931–1936).
*   **UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)**: Led the Indian delegation (1946–1951) and served on the Executive Board.
*   **Oxford University**: Held the prestigious H.N. Spalding Chair of Eastern Religions and Ethics (1936–1952).","Radhakrishnan's impact is profound, both in India and globally. He successfully articulated Hindu philosophy in terms that were accessible and respectable to the Western academic world, effectively defending it against what he termed ""uninformed Western criticism."" His work was instrumental in shaping the West's understanding of Hinduism and Indian thought. As a statesman, his philosophical background informed his political vision, advocating for a creative internationalism based on the spiritual foundations of integral experience. His influence on the Indian education system, particularly through his work as Chairman of the University Education Commission, laid the philosophical groundwork for post-independence higher education. He is celebrated as the ""Philosopher-King"" who brought philosophical depth to the highest offices of the Indian state.","The central concept in Radhakrishnan's philosophy is **Integral Experience** (or **Intuition**), which he viewed as the ultimate form of knowledge that coordinates and synthesizes all other experiences (cognitive, psychic, aesthetic, ethical, and religious). He distinguished this from mere intellectual knowledge, arguing that intuition is immediate, self-certifying (*svatassiddha*), and the source of all creativity and progress. Other key concepts include:
*   **Religious Pluralism**: The affirmation that all religions are interpretations of a common experience rooted in the ultimate reality, with Vedanta being the most profound expression.
*   **The Religion of the Spirit**: His term for a universal, non-dogmatic, and experiential religion that he identified with the highest form of Hinduism.
*   **Reinterpretation of Maya**: Understanding *maya* as a subjective misperception rather than an objective illusion, thereby giving a greater degree of reality to the phenomenal world.","Radhakrishnan's legacy remains highly relevant today, particularly in the fields of comparative religion, philosophy, and education. His emphasis on **religious pluralism** and the search for common ground among different faiths is a vital message in a globalized and often polarized world. His vision of education, which promotes holistic development, moral values, and self-awareness, continues to influence educational reform in India and beyond. He is remembered annually on his birthday, September 5th, which is celebrated as **Teachers' Day** in India, honoring his dedication to education and scholarship. His followers are primarily those in academic philosophy, comparative religion, and the political and educational sectors who adhere to his vision of a modern, rational, and inclusive Hinduism.",
Swami Sivananda - yoga guru and founder of the Divine Life Society,Swami Sivananda Saraswati,"Born Kuppuswami on 8 September 1887 in Pattamadai, Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu), British India. He studied medicine in Tanjore and practiced as a physician in British Malaya for ten years, known for providing free treatment to the poor. He left his medical career in 1923 to pursue a spiritual quest, was initiated into the Sannyasa order in 1924 in Rishikesh by his Guru, Vishwānanda Saraswati, and was given the name Swami Sivananda Saraswati. He entered Mahasamadhi on 14 July 1963 at the age of 75 at his Sivananda Ashram in Muni Ki Reti, Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand), India [1].","His core teaching is the **Yoga of Synthesis** (or *Sivananda Yoga*), a practical, all-encompassing path that harmoniously combines the four main Yogas of Hinduism: **Karma Yoga** (Selfless Service), **Bhakti Yoga** (Devotion), **Jnana Yoga** (Knowledge/Vedanta), and **Rāja Yoga** (Meditation/Mental Control). His philosophy is summarized by the universal ethical maxim: ""Be Good, Do Good"" [1]. His spiritual contribution was the **democratization and propagation of Yoga and Vedanta** to the masses, using modern methods of communication, which helped bridge the gap between traditional monasticism and the modern world [1].","Swami Sivananda was a prolific author, writing over 200 books on Yoga, Vedanta, and health. Key publications include: *Raja Yoga: theory and practice* (1950), *The Science of Pranayama*, *Thought Power*, *Autobiography of Swami Sivananda* (1980), *All About Hinduism*, *Moksha Gita* (1949), *Karma yoga* (1985), and *Bhakti yoga* (1987) [1].","The primary organization he founded is the **Divine Life Society (DLS)** in 1936 in Muni Ki Reti, Rishikesh, which serves as the headquarters for his mission of spiritual knowledge dissemination and selfless service. Other organizations include the **Sivananda Ashram**, the **Sivananda Ayurvedic Pharmacy** (1945), the **All-world Religions Federation** (1945), the **All-world Sadhus Federation** (1947), and the **Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy** (1948) [1].","Swami Sivananda is one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the 20th century. His impact is seen in the **global dissemination** of Yoga and Vedanta through his numerous disciples, such as Swami Vishnudevananda (founder of Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres), who spread his teachings worldwide. He was a pioneer in the **modernization of outreach**, using printing, mail, and extensive tours to spread his message, earning him the nickname 'Swami Propagandananda' from critics. His **Yoga of Synthesis** provided a practical, non-sectarian path suitable for householders, which was highly influential in the post-independence era of India and abroad [1].","The central innovation is the **Yoga of Synthesis**, which provided a balanced, holistic approach to spiritual practice, preventing practitioners from becoming one-sided. Other key concepts include the simple, universal ethical maxim **""Be Good, Do Good""** and his commitment to **Universalism**, demonstrated by his organization of the All-world Religions Federation and All-world Sadhus Federation, which emphasized the universal essence of all spiritual paths. His teachings are firmly rooted in **Advaita Vedanta**, applying the principle of the oneness of *Brahman* and *Atman* to see God in all existence [1].","His teachings remain highly relevant today due to their practicality and non-sectarian nature. The emphasis on service, health (through Hatha Yoga), and mental control (through Raja Yoga) resonates with contemporary concerns for well-being and social responsibility. Contemporary followers are found in the **Divine Life Society** and the globally operating **Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres**, which popularized the ""Sivananda Yoga"" style (a five-point system). Notable disciples who carried on his work include Swami Chidananda Saraswati, Swami Krishnananda, and Swami Satyananda Saraswati [1].",
