# Bhagavad Gita - Major Commentarial Traditions

## Three Main Commentaries

The Bhagavad Gita has been interpreted by the three major schools of Vedanta philosophy, each offering a distinct philosophical perspective:

### 1. Adi Shankaracharya - Advaita Vedanta (Non-Dualism)

**Philosophy**: Absolute non-dualism - the individual soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman) are identical

**Key Interpretations**:
- The world is mithya (illusory/apparent)
- Liberation (moksha) is the realization of one's true nature as Brahman
- Jnana (knowledge) is the primary means to liberation
- Karma yoga and bhakti yoga are preparatory practices for jnana yoga
- The personal God (Saguna Brahman) is a lower truth; the impersonal Brahman (Nirguna Brahman) is the ultimate reality

**Commentary**: *Bhagavad Gita Bhashya* by Adi Shankaracharya

**Translation**: Swami Gambhirananda's English translation with Shankara's commentary (Advaita Ashrama)

### 2. Ramanujacharya - Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (Qualified Non-Dualism)

**Philosophy**: Qualified non-dualism - Brahman is a personal God (Vishnu/Narayana) with attributes, and individual souls and the world are real but dependent on Brahman

**Key Interpretations**:
- The individual soul and the world are real, not illusory
- Brahman is a personal God with infinite auspicious qualities
- The soul is eternally distinct from God but dependent on God
- Bhakti (devotion) is the primary means to liberation
- Karma yoga and jnana yoga lead to bhakti yoga
- Liberation is attaining the divine realm and eternal service to God

**Commentary**: *Bhagavad Gita Bhashya* by Ramanujacharya

### 3. Madhvacharya - Dvaita Vedanta (Dualism)

**Philosophy**: Dualism - God, individual souls, and the world are eternally and fundamentally distinct

**Key Interpretations**:
- God (Vishnu/Krishna) is supreme and independent
- Individual souls are eternally dependent on God
- The world is real and created by God
- There is an eternal distinction between God, souls, and matter
- Bhakti yoga is the only means to liberation
- Liberation is not merging with God but eternal proximity and service to God

**Commentary**: *Gita Bhashya* and *Gita Tatparya* by Madhvacharya

**Availability**: Archive.org has "Geeta Bhashya Tatparya Nirnaya by Madhvacharya"
