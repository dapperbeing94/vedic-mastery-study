TEXT: Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Patañjali Yoga-sūtra)
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is a foundational text of classical Yoga philosophy, consisting of 195 or 196 Sanskrit aphorisms (sutras). It was compiled by the sage Patanjali, who is generally dated by modern scholars to around 400 CE, though the text incorporates material from traditions dating back to the 2nd century BCE. The text is a systematic compilation and organization of knowledge from older Yoga traditions, Samkhya philosophy, and possibly Buddhist concepts. Its significance lies in its role as the definitive text for Raja Yoga (Classical Yoga), providing a structured, eight-limbed path (Ashtanga Yoga) to spiritual liberation.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
The core philosophy is encapsulated in the second sutra: **Yogaś citta-vritti-nirodhaḥ** (Yoga is the restriction of the fluctuations of mindstuff). The text adopts the dualistic metaphysics of the Samkhya school, distinguishing between **Purusha** (pure consciousness, the Seer) and **Prakriti** (nature, matter, the cognitive apparatus). The ultimate goal is **Kaivalya** (isolation or liberation), which is the realization of Purusha as distinct from Prakriti and the cessation of the mind's modifications (*vrittis*). The path to this liberation is through discriminative discernment (*viveka-khyāti*) achieved by systematic practice.

STRUCTURE:
The text is divided into four chapters or Padas (quarters):

1.  **Samadhi Pada** (51 Sutras): Deals with the goal of Yoga (Samadhi, or meditative absorption), the nature of the mind's modifications (*vrittis*), and the means to still them, primarily through practice (*abhyasa*) and non-attachment (*vairagya*).
2.  **Sadhana Pada** (55 Sutras): Outlines the practical path. It introduces **Kriya Yoga** (tapas, svādhyāya, īśvara praṇidhāna) and the first five limbs of **Ashtanga Yoga** (Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara).
3.  **Vibhuti Pada** (56 Sutras): Describes the last three limbs of Ashtanga Yoga—**Samyama** (Dhāraṇā, Dhyāna, and Samādhi)—which are practiced together. It details the extraordinary powers (*siddhis*) that arise from Samyama, while also warning that attachment to these powers is an obstacle to liberation.
4.  **Kaivalya Pada** (34 Sutras): Describes the nature of liberation (*Kaivalya*), the process of emancipation, and the ultimate reality of the Seer (Purusha). This chapter is often considered a later addition by scholars.

KEY VERSES:
The following are some of the most significant and frequently cited sutras:

COMMENTATORS:
The study of the Yoga Sutras is inseparable from its commentarial tradition. The most important commentators include:

*   **Vyāsa (c. 5th century CE):** Author of the **Yogabhāṣya** (Commentary on the Yoga Sutras), which is the oldest and most authoritative commentary. Some scholars suggest Patanjali himself may have written the *bhāṣya* along with the *sutras* as a single work (*Pātañjalayogaśāstra*).
*   **Vācaspati Miśra (c. 9th century CE):** Author of the **Tattvavaiśāradī**, a super-commentary on the *Yogabhāṣya*. It is considered the next most authoritative commentary after Vyāsa's.
*   **Bhoja Rāja (c. 11th century CE):** Author of the **Rājamārtaṇḍa**, which is a concise and influential commentary.
*   **Vijñānabhikṣu (c. 16th century CE):** Author of the **Yogavārttika**, a detailed and insightful commentary that attempts to reconcile the Yoga school with Advaita Vedanta, though it is fundamentally rooted in the Samkhya-Yoga tradition.

Modern commentators like **Swami Vivekananda** (who popularized the text in the West), **B.K.S. Iyengar** (*Light on the Yoga Sutras*), and **T.K.V. Desikachar** have also been highly influential in contemporary practice.

THEMES:
The core themes of the Yoga Sutras are:

*   **The Nature of the Mind (*Citta*):** The text meticulously analyzes the mind-stuff (*citta*), its five types of fluctuations (*vrittis*), and the five causes of suffering (*kleshas*): ignorance (*avidya*), egoism (*asmita*), attachment (*raga*), aversion (*dvesha*), and fear of death (*abhinivesha*).
*   **The Eight Limbs (*Ashtanga*):** The systematic, practical path to self-realization, which moves from external ethical disciplines (Yama and Niyama) to internal practices (Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara) and finally to the stages of meditation (Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi).
*   **Ethical Foundation:** The Yamas (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy/continence, non-possessiveness) and Niyamas (purity, contentment, austerity, self-study, surrender to Ishvara) provide the essential ethical and moral framework for all subsequent practice.
*   **Liberation (*Kaivalya*):** The ultimate goal, defined as the absolute independence of the Purusha from the modifications of the mind and the influence of Prakriti.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
The Yoga Sutras are applied today as a comprehensive guide for mental and spiritual discipline, extending far beyond physical postures (*asana*). The text is used to:

*   **Guide Ethical Living:** The Yamas and Niyamas are adopted as a moral compass for navigating modern life, fostering self-discipline, and improving relationships.
*   **Inform Meditation and Mindfulness:** The concept of *citta-vritti-nirodhaḥ* is the philosophical basis for modern mindfulness and meditation practices, providing techniques for managing stress and achieving mental clarity.
*   **Structure Yoga Practice:** The Ashtanga system provides the philosophical backbone for various modern yoga styles, emphasizing that physical postures are merely one of eight limbs, and that the true practice is internal and meditative.
*   **Psychological Framework:** The analysis of the *kleshas* (causes of suffering) is used as a psychological framework for self-inquiry and therapeutic intervention, helping practitioners identify and overcome deep-seated mental patterns.

RELATIONSHIPS:
The Yoga Sutras are one of the six *āstika* (orthodox) schools of Hindu philosophy, specifically the **Yoga** school, and its relationship with other texts is crucial:

*   **Samkhya:** The Yoga school is often called *Samkhya-Yoga* because it accepts the dualistic metaphysics of Samkhya (Purusha and Prakriti) almost entirely. However, Yoga is distinct in that it is *theistic* (accepting the concept of **Īśvara**, a special Purusha untouched by suffering, as a focus for meditation) and *practical* (emphasizing systematic practice, unlike Samkhya's focus on knowledge).
*   **Vedas and Upanishads:** The Yoga Sutras are part of the broader Vedic tradition. The Upanishads contain early concepts of Yoga, meditation, and the nature of the Self (Atman/Brahman), which Patanjali systematized and refined into a distinct philosophical school.
*   **Bhagavad Gita:** The *Gita* is a synthesis of various Yogas (Karma, Bhakti, Jnana) and is closely related. Patanjali's Kriya Yoga (tapas, svādhyāya, īśvara praṇidhāna) is seen as a formalization of the *Gita's* teachings on action and devotion.
