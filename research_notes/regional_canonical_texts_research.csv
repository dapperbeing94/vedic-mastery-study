"Tirukkural - an ancient Tamil text of 1330 couplets on ethics, politics, and love, attributed to Thiruvalluvar",Tirukkural,"The Tirukkural is traditionally attributed to the poet and philosopher **Thiruvalluvar**, often simply referred to as Valluvar. Little definitive biographical information is known about him, and he is a figure of veneration in Tamil culture. Traditional accounts place him in the third Sangam period, but linguistic and historical analysis suggests he lived later, during the Post-Sangam era. He is revered for his universal wisdom, and the text is sometimes eponymously called 'Tiruvalluvar' in his honor.","The text is composed in **Old Tamil**. Its date of composition is a subject of scholarly debate, with estimates ranging from 300 BCE to the 5th century CE. The most widely accepted scholarly dating, based on linguistic analysis and its relationship to other Sangam and Post-Sangam literature, places the work between **450 and 500 CE**. It is grouped under the *Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku* (Eighteen Lesser Texts) series of the late Sangam works.","The Tirukkural consists of **1,330 couplets** (known as *kurals*), each a concise two-line verse of seven words. These couplets are organized into **133 chapters** of 10 couplets each. The entire work is systematically divided into three major parts, collectively known as *Muppal* (The Three-fold Path):

1.  **Aram (Virtue/Dharma):** Deals with ethics, morality, and the conduct of an individual. (38 chapters)
2.  **Porul (Wealth/Artha):** Focuses on politics, governance, economics, and statecraft. (70 chapters)
3.  **Inbam (Love/Kama):** Addresses domestic life, love, and pleasure. (25 chapters)","The core themes are **universal ethics, politics, and love**, presented in a secular and aphoristic style. The text emphasizes a virtuous life based on principles such as:

*   **Ahimsa (Non-violence):** It strongly advocates for non-killing and moral vegetarianism (*kollamai* and *pulal maruttal*).
*   **Justice and Governance:** *Porul* provides maxims for an ideal ruler, covering topics like administration, taxation, and the role of ministers.
*   **Domestic Virtue:** It extols the virtues of a good spouse, hospitality, gratitude, and self-restraint.

One of the most famous couplets, Kural 619, exemplifies the theme of effort and destiny:
> **தெய்வத்தான் ஆகா தெனினும் முயற்சிதன் மெய்வருத்தக் கூலி தரும்.**
> *Though fate-divine should make your labour vain; effort its payment gives, of body's toil and pain.*","The Tirukkural is a masterpiece of conciseness, written in the **Kural Venba** meter, a specific form of Tamil poetry characterized by its two-line structure (four feet in the first line, three in the second). The style is **aphoristic**, with each couplet functioning as a stand-alone maxim. Its poetic features include a high degree of alliteration and assonance, which contribute to its memorability and rhythmic quality. The language is simple yet profound, contributing to its reputation for **universality and secularity**.","The Tirukkural is a **cultural and literary touchstone** for the Tamil people, often referred to with honorific titles such as **'The Tamil Veda'** (*Tamil Marai*) and **'The Divine Book'** (*Teyvanul*). Its significance lies in its ability to transcend religious and regional boundaries, offering a common code of conduct. It is credited with redefining the cultural and ethical values of the Tamil land, moving away from some of the earlier, more martial or ritualistic traditions. The text is the **most translated** Tamil literary work, with translations in over 57 languages, and has been continuously in print since its first known publication in 1812. The most famous and authoritative commentary is by **Parimelazhagar** (c. 13th century CE).","The Tirukkural's relevance remains profound in the modern world, influencing ethical, social, and political thought. It is a mandatory part of the curriculum in Tamil Nadu schools. Its principles of non-violence and moral conduct have influenced global figures; for instance, **Leo Tolstoy** was inspired by the Kural's concept of non-violence, which in turn was instrumental in **Mahatma Gandhi** reading the text and adopting its principles. In Tamil Nadu politics, the Kural is frequently cited by leaders across the political spectrum to lend moral authority to their policies and speeches, demonstrating its enduring role as a guide for good governance and societal welfare.",
Tevaram and Tirumurai - Tamil Shaiva devotional hymns composed by the Nayanars (7th-9th century CE),Tevaram and Tirumurai - Tamil Shaiva devotional hymns,"The core Tevaram hymns (the first seven volumes of Tirumurai) were composed by the three most prominent Nayanars: Thirugnana Sambandar, Thirunavukkarasar (Appar), and Sundarar. The entire Tirumurai is a twelve-volume compendium of songs by 63 Nayanars and other poets. The compilation of the Tirumurai was undertaken by Nambi Andar Nambi in the 10th to 12th century CE.","The hymns were composed over a period spanning the **6th to 11th centuries CE**, with the core Tevaram hymns dating primarily to the **7th and 8th centuries CE**. The language of composition is **Tamil**, and these texts are considered the canonical scriptures of Tamil Shaivism.","The **Tirumurai** (Holy Division) is a massive **twelve-volume compendium** of Tamil Shaiva hymns. The first seven volumes are collectively known as the **Tevaram**, which contains the works of the three principal Nayanars (Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar). The remaining five volumes contain the works of other Nayanars and poets, including the *Tiruvachakam* (Eighth Tirumurai) by Manikkavasagar and the *Tirumantiram* (Tenth Tirumurai) by Tirumular. The compilation is organized chronologically and by author, with the Tevaram alone containing 796 hymns and over 8,200 stanzas.","The central theme is **Bhakti** (devotion) to the Hindu deity **Shiva**. The hymns express intense, personal, and emotional love for Shiva, often addressing him as a friend, master, or lover. Key teachings include the omnipresence of Shiva, the importance of visiting Shiva temples (known as *Padal Petra Sthalams*), and the path to liberation through devotion and surrender. The hymns also contain philosophical ideas, including the synthesis of devotional poetry with yogic and tantric concepts, particularly in the later texts like the *Tirumantiram* (Tenth Tirumurai).","The literary style is characterized by **exquisite poetry of passion and intensity**, marked by deep emotional Bhakti. The hymns are set to specific **Tamil musical modes** (*pann*), making them a unique blend of literature and music. A characteristic feature is the **incorporation of place names** of the temples the Nayanars visited, effectively creating a spiritual geography of the Tamil country. The poetry is highly lyrical, using rich imagery, metaphors, and allusions to Hindu mythology, particularly the legends of Shiva.","The Tirumurai is the **canonical scripture of Tamil Shaivism** and is often referred to as the **Tamil Veda**. Its cultural significance lies in its role in the **Bhakti Movement** in South India, which popularized devotion to Shiva among all sections of society, transcending caste barriers. The hymns were instrumental in the revival of Shaivism and the construction of the spiritual landscape of Tamil Nadu, as the 276 temples praised in the Tevaram (*Padal Petra Sthalams*) became major pilgrimage centers. The texts are revered as a priceless legacy of ancient Tamil poetry, second only to the Sangam literature.","The Tirumurai, and especially the Tevaram, remains a **living tradition** in Tamil Nadu and among the global Tamil diaspora. The hymns are continuously sung by **Oduvars** (temple singers) in Shiva temples as part of daily rituals, preserving the ancient musical tradition. The texts are a vital source of inspiration for **Carnatic musicians**, who draw on the *pann* (musical modes) for their compositions. Furthermore, the texts serve as a **cultural and linguistic anchor**, reinforcing Tamil identity and the continuity of the Tamil Bhakti tradition.",
Ramcharitmanas - Hindi retelling of the Ramayana by Tulsidas (16th century CE),Ramcharitmanas,"Goswami Tulsidas (c. 1511–1623 CE), a revered 16th-century Indian *bhakti* poet and philosopher. Tulsidas was a great scholar of Sanskrit but chose to compose the *Ramcharitmanas* in the vernacular Awadhi language to make the story of Rama accessible to the common people, who were largely excluded from the Sanskrit tradition. He is considered an incarnation of Valmiki, the author of the original Sanskrit *Ramayana*.","The composition began in Ayodhya in **Vikram Samvat 1631 (1574 CE)**, on the ninth day of the month of Chaitra (Rama Navami). The work was completed over two years, seven months, and twenty-six days. The language of the text is **Awadhi**, a vernacular dialect of Hindi spoken in the Awadh region of North India. Tulsidas's choice of a vernacular language, rather than the classical Sanskrit of Valmiki's *Ramayana*, was revolutionary and instrumental in popularizing the epic.","The *Ramcharitmanas* is structured into seven books, known as **Kānds** (episodes or cantos), which Tulsidas metaphorically compared to seven steps leading into the holy waters of Lake Manasarovar (*Manas*). The narrative follows the life of Rama from birth to his return to Ayodhya.

| Kānd (Book) | Title (English) | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Bāl Kāṇḍ** | Childhood Episode | Birth of Rama, childhood exploits, marriage to Sita. |
| **2. Ayodhyā Kāṇḍ** | Ayodhya Episode | Rama's preparation for coronation, exile to the forest. |
| **3. Araṇya Kāṇḍ** | Forest Episode | Life in the forest, abduction of Sita by Ravana. |
| **4. Kiśkindhā Kāṇḍ** | Kishkindha Episode | Rama's alliance with Sugriva, meeting with Hanuman. |
| **5. Sundar Kāṇḍ** | Pleasant Episode | Hanuman's journey to Lanka, meeting with Sita, and setting Lanka ablaze. This is the most popular section for recitation. |
| **6. Laṅkā Kāṇḍ** | Lanka Episode | The battle between Rama and Ravana, Ravana's defeat, and Rama's return to Ayodhya. |
| **7. Uttar Kāṇḍ** | Later Episode | Rama's coronation, philosophical discourses, and the eventual departure of Rama and his brothers from the world. |","The central theme is **Bhakti** (loving devotion) to Rama, who Tulsidas portrays not merely as a heroic prince but as the Supreme Being (*Para Brahman*), an incarnation of Vishnu. The text emphasizes the path of devotion as the most accessible means to salvation in the Kali Yuga. Other core teachings include:
*   **Dharma (Righteousness)**: The text is a profound meditation on moral duty and ideal conduct, exemplified by Rama as *Maryada Purushottam* (The Ideal Man).
*   **Ideal Relationships**: It provides models for ideal human relationships, such as the devotion of a wife (Sita), the loyalty of a brother (Lakshmana and Bharata), and the servitude of a devotee (Hanuman).
*   **The Battle of Good and Evil**: The narrative reinforces the triumph of virtue over vice, with Rama's victory over the demon-king Ravana.","The *Ramcharitmanas* is a masterpiece of medieval Indian poetry, distinguished by its unique blend of narrative, philosophy, and devotional fervor. The primary poetic forms are the **Chaupai** (a four-line quatrain) and the **Doha** (a two-line couplet), which are interspersed with *Sorathas* and various *Chhandas*. This rhythmic structure makes the text highly musical and suitable for public recitation and singing, a key factor in its widespread popularity. The style is devotional (*bhakti*), focusing on the emotional and personal relationship between the devotee and God, a departure from the more classical, heroic style of the Sanskrit *Ramayana*. The language is rich in imagery and accessible to the common person.","The *Ramcharitmanas* holds unparalleled cultural and religious significance, often referred to as ""the living sum of Indian culture"" and ""the greatest book of all devotional literature.""
*   **Religious Significance**: It is the most popular retelling of the Ramayana in North India and is central to the worship of Rama. It solidified the *bhakti* movement's focus on a personal, loving God, making spiritual life accessible to all castes and genders.
*   **Cultural Impact**: The text is the foundation for the *Ramleela*, the dramatic folk re-enactment of Rama's life, which is performed annually across India and is recognized as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
*   **Unifying Force**: It served as a unifying force in medieval India, bridging the gap between the elite Sanskrit tradition and the popular vernacular tradition. It also reconciled various philosophical schools by presenting Rama as both the transcendent Brahman and the immanent, personal God.","The *Ramcharitmanas* remains one of the most influential texts in North Indian culture. Its modern relevance is profound:
*   **Spiritual and Moral Compass**: It continues to serve as a primary source of moral and spiritual guidance, with its teachings on *dharma*, devotion, and ideal conduct being studied and recited daily by millions.
*   **Cultural Identity**: For many Hindus, the text is a cornerstone of their cultural and religious identity, with public recitations (*Ramcharitmanas Path*) and dramatic enactments (*Ramleela*) being major cultural events.
*   **Linguistic Influence**: It played a critical role in the development and standardization of the Awadhi dialect and has profoundly influenced modern Hindi literature.
*   **Social Reform**: By making the story of Rama accessible in a vernacular language, Tulsidas democratized religious knowledge, moving it beyond the exclusive domain of Sanskrit scholars.
*   **Translations and Commentaries**: The text has been translated into numerous Indian and international languages, and countless commentaries exist, ensuring its teachings remain relevant to contemporary issues. The *Sundar Kāṇḍ* chapter, in particular, is widely recited for strength and success.",
