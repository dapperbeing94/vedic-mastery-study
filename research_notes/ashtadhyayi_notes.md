## Key Information

### Title and Meaning
- **Aṣṭādhyāyī** (अष्टाध्यायी)
- Literally "Eight Chapters"
- Foundational text of Sanskrit grammar (Vyakarana Vedanga)

### Author and Dating
- **Author**: Pāṇini (पाणिनि)
- **Period**: 6th-5th century BCE (late Vedic period)
- **Place**: Northwest India (ancient Gandhara region)

### Structure
- **8 chapters** (Adhyaya)
- Each chapter divided into **4 quarters** (Pada)
- Total: **~4,000 sutras** (grammatical rules)
- Includes **14 Pratyahara** (shorthand notations)

### Types of Rules

The Ashtadhyayi uses six types of rules:

1. **Saṃjñā** (संज्ञा) - Definition
   - Takes ordinary words and gives them specialized technical meanings
   - Example: "vṛddhi" (growth) redefined as specific vowel changes

2. **Vidhi** (विधि) - General Rule
   - Describes how Sanskrit actually behaves
   - Covers word formation, sandhi, etc.
   - Most rules are of this type

3. **Niyama** (नियम) - Exception
   - Contradicts or modifies an earlier vidhi rule
   - Provides exceptions to general rules

4. **Atideśa** (अतिदेश) - Rule of Analogy
   - Specifies that one feature has properties of another
   - Useful for complex rules acting on specific terms

5. **Adhikāra** (अधिकार) - Governing Rule
   - Extends an idea to multiple following rules
   - Its range of application is called **anuvṛtti**

6. **Paribhāṣā** (परिभाषा) - Rule of Interpretation
   - Meta-rules that tell readers how to interpret other rules
   - Addresses the reader, not the grammar itself

### Key Features

**Oral Tradition**:
- Originally taught orally
- Students memorized the entire work
- Could recall any rule at will
- Must be approached cyclically, not linearly

**Density and Brevity**:
- Extremely concise formulation
- Some rules are only one syllable (e.g., "ot")
- Rules depend on context from previous rules
- Ideas carry over across multiple rules

**Systematic Organization**:
- Rules arranged by topic and function
- Uses shorthand notation (Pratyahara)
- Complex system of cross-references
- Rules in one chapter may control rules in another

### Significance

**Foundation of Sanskrit**:
- Defines Classical Sanskrit grammar
- Most comprehensive grammar ever written for any language
- Influenced linguistic theory worldwide
- Precursor to modern formal language theory

**Computational Linguistics**:
- Considered first formal grammar system
- Influenced computer science and AI
- Backus-Naur Form (BNF) compared to Paninian grammar
- Relevant to natural language processing

### Cross-References
- **Mahabhashya** - Patanjali's great commentary on Ashtadhyayi
- **Vartika** - Katyayana's critical notes
- **Ganapatha** - Lists of words referenced in sutras
- **Dhatupatha** - List of verbal roots
- **Nirukta** - Yaska's etymology (predates Panini)
