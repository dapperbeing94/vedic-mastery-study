"Nyaya - Hindu school of logic, epistemology, and systematic reasoning",,"The founder of the Nyāya school is traditionally held to be **Akṣapāda Gautama** (also known as Gotama or Akṣapāda), who is credited with composing the foundational text, the *Nyāya Sūtras*, around the 2nd century CE.

Key proponents and commentators include:
*   **Vātsyāyana** (author of *Nyāya Bhāṣya*, a classic commentary on the *Nyāya Sūtras*).
*   **Udyotakara** (author of *Nyāya Vārttika*).
*   **Udayana** (10th century CE), whose *Nyāyakusumāñjali* is the first systematic account of theistic Nyāya.
*   **Gangeśa Upādhyāya** (14th century CE), the founder of the later, highly influential school of **Navya-Nyāya** (New Nyāya).","The core philosophy of Nyāya is the systematic development of the theory of **logic** and **epistemology** (Pramāṇa-śāstra). Its ultimate goal is **Moksha** (liberation), which is achieved through the acquisition of **right knowledge** (*pramā*) and the removal of wrong knowledge or delusion (*mithyā-jñāna*). Nyāya is a form of **direct realism** (*pratyakṣa-vāda*), asserting that the world consists of stable, knowable objects and that our cognitions accurately reveal external reality. The school holds that human suffering results from mistakes and defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge, and liberation is the state of unimpeded continuation of the self after the removal of this ignorance. The entire system is structured around **sixteen categories** (*ṣoḍaśa padārthas*) of philosophical topics, starting with the means of valid knowledge (*pramāṇa*) and the objects of valid knowledge (*prameya*), and extending to the principles of debate and logical fallacies.","The foundational text of the school is the **Nyāya Sūtras**, attributed to Akṣapāda Gautama. It is divided into five books and systematically lays out the sixteen categories of philosophical inquiry.

Other key texts and commentaries include:
*   ***Nyāya Bhāṣya*** by Vātsyāyana (classic commentary on the *Nyāya Sūtras*).
*   ***Nyāya Vārttika*** by Udyotakara (a defense of Vātsyāyana's work).
*   ***Nyāyakusumāñjali*** by Udayana (a systematic defense of theism).
*   ***Tattvacintāmaṇi*** by Gangeśa Upādhyāya (the foundational text of Navya-Nyāya).
*   ***Tarkasaṁgraha*** and ***Dīpikā*** by Annaṁbhaṭṭa (17th century CE), popular manuals that synthesize Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika.","Nyāya epistemology accepts **four** out of the six *pramāṇas* (reliable means of gaining knowledge) as valid:
1.  **Pratyakṣa (Perception):** Direct sensory and non-erroneous cognition. It is considered the foremost source of knowledge and is divided into *laukika* (ordinary) and *alaukika* (extraordinary) perception.
2.  **Anumāṇa (Inference):** Logical reasoning based on the invariable concomitance (*vyāpti*) between a sign (*hetu*) and the object to be proved (*sādhya*). The Nyāya system is famous for its rigorous, five-step syllogism (*parārthānumāna*).
3.  **Upamāna (Comparison/Analogy):** Knowledge gained through the similarity between a known object and an unknown object, often used to establish the meaning of a word.
4.  **Śabda (Word/Testimony):** Knowledge derived from the verbal testimony of a reliable and trustworthy person (*āptavākya*). This includes both *Vaidika* (Vedic) and *Laukika* (secular) testimony, with the former being preferred.

The school also developed a sophisticated **theory of error** (*Anyathākhyātivāda*), which explains illusion as the misapprehension of an object as something else that exists elsewhere, mediated by revived memory (*jñānalakṣaṇapratyāsatti*).","Nyāya metaphysics is characterized by its **realist and pluralistic ontology**, often studied in conjunction with the Vaiśeṣika school, leading to the syncretic **Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika** system.

The Nyāya system is structured around **sixteen categories** (*ṣoḍaśa padārthas*), which are the subjects of philosophical inquiry, including *pramāṇa* (means of knowledge) and *prameya* (objects of knowledge). The *prameya* category itself encompasses the six (or seven) categories of the Vaiśeṣika school: *dravya* (substance), *guṇa* (quality), *karma* (action), *sāmānya* (generality), *viśeṣa* (particularity), *samavāya* (inherence), and *abhāva* (non-existence).

Key metaphysical positions include:
*   **Atomism:** The world is composed of eternal, indivisible atoms (borrowed from Vaiśeṣika).
*   **Self (*Ātman*):** The self is a distinct, non-physical substance that is not inherently conscious but acquires consciousness when connected to the mind (*manas*).
*   **Causation (*Asatkāryavāda*):** Nyāya adheres to the theory of **new creation** (also known as *ārambhavāda*), which states that the effect is a new creation and does not pre-exist in its cause. It recognizes three kinds of cause: *samavāyi* (material), *asamavāyi* (non-material/concomitant), and *nimitta* (efficient).","Nyāya is one of the six orthodox (*Āstika*) schools of Hindu philosophy. Its relationship with other Darśanas is primarily defined by:

*   **Vaiśeṣika:** Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika are so closely related that they are often treated as a single school, **Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika**. Nyāya provides the rigorous **epistemology and logic** (the method of inquiry), while Vaiśeṣika provides the **metaphysics and ontology** (the categories of reality). Their synthesis is one of the most vigorous efforts at constructing a substantialist, realist ontology in Indian philosophy.
*   **Sāṃkhya and Yoga:** Nyāya shares the goal of liberation (*mokṣa*) through knowledge, but it differs in its dualism and realism. Nyāya's theistic arguments (especially in later periods) contrast with the atheistic tendencies of classical Sāṃkhya.
*   **Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta:** Nyāya's logical framework and theory of *pramāṇas* were widely adopted and adapted by the Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta schools for their own scholastic purposes, particularly in the interpretation of Vedic texts. However, they disagree on the number of valid *pramāṇas* (e.g., Advaita Vedānta accepts six).
*   **Buddhism:** Nyāya engaged in extensive debates with Buddhist schools, particularly on the nature of the self, reality, and momentariness. Nyāya's defense of a permanent self and external realism stands in direct opposition to the Buddhist doctrines of *anātman* (no-self) and idealism.","The historical development of Nyāya is generally divided into two phases: **Prācīna Nyāya** (Ancient Nyāya) and **Navya-Nyāya** (New Nyāya). Prācīna Nyāya, based on the *Nyāya Sūtras*, focused on logic and epistemology. Later scholars, such as Udayana, introduced theistic arguments, attempting to prove the existence of God (*Īśvara*).

The most significant influence of Nyāya is its contribution to **Indian logic and methodology**, which was subsequently adopted by the majority of other orthodox schools, including Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta, for interpreting their own texts. The rigorous, five-step syllogism and the detailed analysis of logical fallacies (*hetvābhāsa*) became the standard for philosophical debate and inquiry across India. The Navya-Nyāya school, founded by Gangeśa Upādhyāya, further refined the logical and epistemological tools into a highly technical and precise language, which profoundly influenced scholastic thought in India for centuries. The school's emphasis on right knowledge as the path to liberation also provided a strong philosophical foundation for various Hindu spiritual practices.",
"Vaisheshika - Hindu school of atomism, natural philosophy, and metaphysics",Vaisheshika (Vaiśeṣika) Darśana,"The Vaisheshika school was founded by the sage **Kaṇāda** (also known as Uluka), who is credited with composing the foundational text, the *Vaiśeṣika Sūtra*, likely between the 6th and 2nd century BCE. A pivotal figure in the school's development was **Praśastapāda** (c. 4th century CE), whose *Padārthadharmasaṁgraha* systematically elaborated on the Vaisheshika categories.","The Vaisheshika Darśana is a school of **pluralistic realism** and **atomism** (*Paramāṇu-vāda*). Its central tenet is that the entire universe is composed of distinct, real entities that can be categorized and understood. The school posits that all physical objects are reducible to **paramāṇu** (atoms), which are indivisible, indestructible, and eternal. The ultimate goal of the philosophy is **liberation** (*moksha*), which is achieved through a complete and accurate knowledge of the world of experience, particularly the categories of existence (*padārthas*). This knowledge leads to the cessation of suffering and the realization of the true nature of the self (*ātman*). The school's principles, particularly the categories of *Sāmānya* (Generality) and *Viśeṣa* (Particularity), are foundational to the theoretical framework of **Ayurveda**.","The earliest systematic exposition is the **Vaiśeṣika Sūtra** of Kaṇāda. The most significant commentary and independent treatise is the **Padārthadharmasaṁgraha** by Praśastapāda. Other important commentaries include *Daśapadārthaśāstra*, *Vyomavatī*, *Nyāyakandalī*, *Kiraṇāvalī*, *Līlāvatī*, and *Upaskara* by Śaṁkara Miśra.","The Vaisheshika school, in its original form, accepts only **two** valid means of knowledge (*pramāṇas*): **Pratyakṣa** (Perception—direct experience through senses and mind) and **Anumāna** (Inference—reaching a new conclusion by applying reason to observations). This contrasts with the later combined Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school, which adopted the four *pramāṇas* of Nyāya.","The Vaisheshika system is primarily an ontological classification of the world, defining all knowable objects of experience (*artha*) into six fundamental **Padārthas** (categories of existence): **Dravya** (Substance), **Guṇa** (Quality), **Karma** (Activity/Motion), **Sāmānya** (Generality/Universal), **Viśeṣa** (Particularity), and **Samavāya** (Inherence). Later thinkers added a seventh category, **Abhāva** (Non-existence). The school's **atomism** posits nine substances, including four types of atoms (*pṛthvī*, *ap*, *tejas*, *vāyu*), and five non-atomic substances (*ākāśa*, *kāla*, *dik*, *ātman*, and *manas*).","The Vaisheshika school is most famously associated with the **Nyāya** school, with which it eventually merged to form the **Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika** system. Vaisheshika contributed the **metaphysical framework** (the categories of existence), while Nyāya contributed the **epistemological and logical framework**. It is an **Āstika** (orthodox) school, accepting the authority of the Vedas, but it stands in contrast to the monistic philosophies of **Advaita Vedānta**, which reject its pluralistic realism and atomistic structure of reality. It shares the concept of **atomism** (*paramāṇu*) with some schools of Jainism.","The Vaisheshika Darśana began as an independent school, but its historical trajectory is defined by its eventual **syncretism with Nyāya** around the 4th century CE, forming the highly influential **Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika** system. This combined school became the dominant orthodox school of Hindu philosophy for centuries, providing the foundational principles of logic, epistemology, and ontology for much of later Indian thought. Its detailed **atomistic theory** is one of the earliest and most sophisticated in world history, and its categories provided the theoretical basis for the science of **Ayurveda**.",
"Mimamsa (Purva Mimamsa) - Hindu school of Vedic exegesis, ritual interpretation, and dharma",Mimamsa (Purva Mimamsa),"The foundational text of the school is the **Mimamsa Sutra** (or **Purva Mimamsa Sutras**), composed by **Jaimini** (estimated to be between 300 and 200 BCE) [1]. The school's philosophical doctrines were later systematized and developed by key proponents, most notably the commentator **Śabara** (Śabarasvāmin, c. 5th-6th century CE), and the two great medieval scholars who founded the main sub-schools: **Kumārila Bhaṭṭa** (c. 7th century CE) and **Prabhākara Miśra** (c. 7th century CE) [6].","The core philosophy of Mimamsa, also known as **Karma Mimamsa**, is the **critical investigation (Mimamsa)** of the **karma-kāṇḍa** (ritual section) of the Vedas. It is fundamentally a school of **orthopraxy** and **Vedic exegesis**, asserting that the ultimate goal of life is the performance of **dharma** (duty, righteousness) as prescribed by the Vedic injunctions [1] [2]. The Vedas are considered **eternal, author-less (apauruṣeya), and infallible**, and their injunctions (vidhi) are the sole source of knowledge about dharma [3]. The school holds that the performance of Vedic rituals and sacrifices (karma) generates an unseen potency called **Apurva**, which ensures the future, inevitable result (e.g., heaven) of the action, thereby bridging the time gap between the ritual and its fruit [4] [5]. Mimamsa emphasizes action and duty over asceticism and speculative knowledge (jnana) as the path to the highest good.","The foundational text is the **Mimamsa Sutra** (also known as **Purva Mimamsa Sutras**) by **Jaimini** [1]. The most important commentary on the Sutras is the **Śabara Bhāṣya** by **Śabarasvāmin** [6]. The two major sub-schools are based on the works of their founders:
*   **Bhaṭṭa School:** Key works include **Ślokavārttika**, **Tantravārttika**, and **Ṭupṭīkā** by **Kumārila Bhaṭṭa** [6].
*   **Prābhākara School:** Key works include **Bṛhatī** and **Laghvī** by **Prabhākara Miśra** [6].","Mimamsa is highly influential in Indian epistemology, particularly for its theory of knowledge and valid means of knowledge (**pramāṇas**). The school is famous for its doctrine of **svataḥprāmāṇya** (intrinsic validity of knowledge), which holds that knowledge is inherently valid and self-certifying; its invalidity must be proven by external factors [1]. The two main sub-schools, the **Bhaṭṭa** school (founded by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa) and the **Prābhākara** school (founded by Prabhākara Miśra), differ on the number of accepted pramāṇas:
*   **Bhaṭṭa School (Kumārila):** Accepts **six** pramāṇas: **Perception (Pratyakṣa)**, **Inference (Anumāna)**, **Testimony (Śabda)**, **Comparison (Upamāna)**, **Postulation (Arthāpatti)**, and **Non-apprehension (Anupalabdhi)** [6].
*   **Prābhākara School:** Accepts **five** pramāṇas, rejecting Non-apprehension as a distinct means of knowledge [6].
The Mimamsa school's detailed analysis of verbal testimony (Śabda) and hermeneutics is its most significant contribution to Indian philosophy [2].","Mimamsa espouses a **realist and pluralist** metaphysics [8]. It views the universe as **eternal** and does not admit of creation or destruction by a divine being; it is a self-sustaining cosmos [6]. The school is generally **atheistic** or **non-theistic** in its early form, as it focuses on the power of the Vedic injunctions and the rituals themselves, rather than on a creator God [3]. The **Self (Ātman)** is considered an eternal, omnipresent, and distinct substance from the body and senses, which is the agent of actions and the experiencer of their results [1]. The concept of **Apurva** is central to its ontology, representing the unseen, intermediate link between a ritualistic act and its future, desired result [4]. Mimamsa accepts the reality of the external world and the plurality of individual souls (ātman) [8].","Mimamsa is closely related to **Vedanta (Uttara Mimamsa)**, and the two are often considered a single, comprehensive system of Vedic inquiry, with Purva Mimamsa dealing with the *karma-kāṇḍa* (ritual) and Uttara Mimamsa dealing with the *jñāna-kāṇḍa* (knowledge/Upanishads) [9]. The two schools share the common name *Mimamsa* (critical investigation) and both are orthodox (*āstika*) schools that accept the authority of the Vedas [1]. However, they differ significantly: Mimamsa emphasizes **karma** (action/ritual) as the path to liberation, while Vedanta emphasizes **jñāna** (knowledge) [9]. Mimamsa's detailed hermeneutical and epistemological methods were adopted and adapted by later Vedanta thinkers, particularly in the Advaita Vedanta school [3]. Mimamsa also shares common ground with the **Nyaya** school in its realism and acceptance of multiple pramāṇas, but it accepts more pramāṇas than the early Nyaya school [6].","Mimamsa's influence is profound and far-reaching, extending beyond philosophy into the practical domains of Hindu life. It provided the **hermeneutical framework** for interpreting the Vedas, which was adopted by all other orthodox schools, including Vedanta [3]. Its principles of interpretation have significantly influenced **Hindu legal thought (Dharmaśāstra)** and the development of Hindu law and jurisprudence [7]. The school's detailed analysis of language, meaning, and knowledge (epistemology) also contributed significantly to the development of Indian linguistics and logic [2]. While often overshadowed by Vedanta, Mimamsa's focus on ritual and duty remains the bedrock of Hindu religious practice and orthopraxy [1].",
"Samkhya - Hindu school of dualistic philosophy, enumeration of reality principles",Samkhya (Sāṃkhya) Darśana,"The traditional founder of the Samkhya school is the sage **Kapila**, who is mentioned in ancient texts like the *Mahābhārata* and the *Bhagavad Gītā*. However, the earliest extant and authoritative text of the classical school is the ***Sāṅkhya-Kārikā*** (c. 350 C.E.), authored by **Īśvarakṛṣṇa**. Other key proponents and ancient masters include **Āsuri** (Kapila's disciple) and **Pañcaśikha**.","The core philosophy of Samkhya is a radical **dualism** that posits two ultimate, eternal, and independent realities: **Puruṣa** (Consciousness) and **Prakṛti** (Nature or primordial matter). The school is traditionally **atheistic** (Nirīśvara Sāṃkhya), not positing a creator God. The universe is a result of the conjunction of the passive, inactive Puruṣa and the active, unconscious Prakṛti. The ultimate goal is **Mokṣa** (liberation), which is achieved through **viveka** (discriminative knowledge)—the realization of the fundamental and absolute difference between the Puruṣa and Prakṛti. Samkhya adheres to the doctrine of **Satkārya-vāda** (the theory of pre-existent effect), which states that the effect is already contained in its material cause, and creation is merely the manifestation of the unmanifest Prakṛti. The practical relevance of Samkhya lies in providing the theoretical framework for the Yoga school, explaining the nature of suffering (the confusion of Puruṣa with Prakṛti) and the path to freedom.","The most important and earliest surviving authoritative text of the classical Samkhya school is the ***Sāṅkhya-Kārikā*** by **Īśvarakṛṣṇa** (c. 350 C.E.), a concise work of 72 verses that systematized the philosophy. Another foundational work mentioned in the *Kārikā* is the ***Ṣaṣṭi-Tantra*** (The Book of Sixty Topics), which is now lost. The ***Sāṅkhya Sūtra*** (or *Kapila Sūtra*), though attributed to Kapila, is a much later text (14th-15th century C.E.). Key commentaries include the *Yukti-dīpikā* and *Sāṅkhya-tattva-kaumudī* by Vācaspati Miśra.","Samkhya accepts **three** valid means of knowledge (**Pramāṇas**):
1.  **Pratyakṣa** (Perception): Direct sensory experience.
2.  **Anumāna** (Inference): Knowledge derived from reasoning and logical deduction.
3.  **Śabda** (Testimony/Reliable Authority): Knowledge gained from trustworthy sources, such as the Vedas or the teachings of a reliable person (Āptavacana).
These three are considered sufficient to establish the existence and nature of the 25 *tattvas* (categories of reality) and to achieve the discriminative knowledge necessary for liberation.","Samkhya is a system of **25 realities** (*tattva-s*). The two fundamental realities are:
1.  **Puruṣa** (Consciousness): The ultimate principle of pure consciousness. It is eternal, unchangeable, inactive, and plural (there are innumerable individual *Puruṣas*).
2.  **Prakṛti** (Nature): The ultimate principle of primordial matter. It is singular, eternal, unconscious, and active. It is the material cause of the entire manifest world.
Prakṛti is composed of three fundamental qualities or constituents (**Guṇas**) which are in a state of equilibrium in the unmanifest state: **Sattva** (light, purity, intelligence), **Rajas** (activity, passion, energy), and **Tamas** (inertia, darkness, dullness). The disturbance of this equilibrium leads to the evolution of the 23 subsequent *tattvas*, which constitute the manifest world (*vyakta*), including the intellect (*Mahat* or *Buddhi*), ego (*Ahaṃkāra*), mind (*Manas*), sense organs, subtle elements (*Tanmātras*), and gross elements (*Mahābhūtas*).","Samkhya is the theoretical foundation for the **Yoga** Darśana (Pātañjala Yoga). Yoga accepts the Samkhya dualistic metaphysics and epistemology but differs by adding the concept of **Īśvara** (a special *Puruṣa* or God) and focusing on the practical, ascetic path (*aṣṭāṅga-yoga*) to achieve the liberation described by Samkhya. Samkhya's concepts, particularly the *guṇa* theory, were widely integrated into later Indian philosophy, especially **Vedānta**. However, Vedānta is **monistic** (Brahman is the sole reality) and fundamentally rejects Samkhya's dualism of Puruṣa and Prakṛti and its classical atheism. Samkhya's atheistic stance also distinguishes it from the theistic schools of Hinduism.","Samkhya is considered one of the oldest and most influential schools of Indian philosophy. Concepts related to Samkhya, such as the *guṇa* theory and cosmic dualism, are found in the Upanishads (*Kaṭha*, *Śvetāśśvatara*) and the *Mahābhārata*, suggesting its antiquity. For a period, it was the representative philosophy of Hindu thought. Its concepts, particularly the **tattva** scheme and the **guṇa** theory, were highly influential and adopted by nearly all other schools of Indian philosophy, including **Yoga** and various schools of **Vedānta**. The school declined as an independent system after the 16th century, largely being absorbed into the Yoga and Vedānta traditions, where its metaphysical framework continues to be foundational. The *guṇa* theory remains a practical psychological and ethical framework used widely in Ayurveda and Yoga to understand temperament and the material world.",
