# Tantra & Agamas - Wikipedia Research Notes

**Source**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agama_(Hinduism)

## Definition and Etymology

**Āgama** (आगम) literally means "tradition" or "that which has come down" - from the verb root गम् (gam) meaning "to go" and the preposition आ (ā) meaning "toward".

The Agamas are a collection of Tantric literature and religious texts of Hindu schools that describe:
- Cosmology
- Epistemology
- Philosophical doctrines
- Precepts on meditation and practices
- Four kinds of yoga
- Mantras
- Temple construction
- Deity worship
- Ways to attain sixfold desires

## Three Main Branches

1. **Shaiva Agamas** (28 texts) - Focused on Shiva
2. **Shakta Agamas/Tantras** (64 texts) - Focused on Shakti/Goddess
3. **Vaishnava Agamas** (108 Pancharatra Samhitas) - Focused on Vishnu

**Total**: 200 major Agama texts + numerous Upa-Agamas

## Structure of Each Agama

Each Agama consists of four parts (padas):

1. **Jnana pada** (Vidya pada) - Philosophical and spiritual knowledge, reality and liberation
2. **Yoga pada** - Precepts on yoga, physical and mental discipline
3. **Kriya pada** - Rules for rituals, temple construction, idol consecration, initiations (diksha)
4. **Charya pada** - Rules of conduct, worship (puja), observances, festivals, prayaschittas

## Relationship to Vedas

- **Vedas**: Common scriptures of all Hinduism (primary and general)
- **Agamas**: Sacred texts of specific sects (special treatises)
- **Timing**: Vedas date to 1st millennium BCE and earlier; Agamas to 1st millennium CE
- **Philosophy**: No Agama that contradicts Vedic literature is acceptable to orthodox traditions
- **Metaphor**: "The Vedas are the path, and the Agamas are the horse" (Tirumular)
- **Another metaphor**: "The Veda is the cow, the true Agama its milk" (Umapati)

## Philosophical Diversity

The Agamas present a diverse range of philosophies:
- **Dualism** (Dvaita) to **Absolute Monism** (Advaita)
- In Shaivism alone:
  - 10 dualistic Agama texts
  - 18 qualified monism-cum-dualism (Bhedabheda) Agama texts
  - 64 monism (Advaita) Agama texts

**Key Traditions**:
- **Shaiva Siddhanta** (Tamil-speaking South India) - Dualistic
- **Kashmir Shaivism** - Non-dualistic, draws on Bhairava Agamas and Shakta Tantras

## Shakta Agamas/Tantras (64 Texts)

- Commonly known as **Tantras**
- Reverence for the feminine, goddess as focus
- Female as equal and essential part of cosmic existence
- Shakti (energy and power) as creative aspect, cosmogonic power
- Masculine and feminine in "state of primordial, transcendent, blissful unity"

**Four/Six Directional Transmissions (Āmnāyas)**:
1. **Pūrvāmnāya** (Eastern) - Trika goddesses (Parā, Parāparā, Aparā)
2. **Uttarāmnāya** (Northern) - Kālikā Krama
3. **Paścimāmnāya** (Western) - Kubjikā and Navātman
4. **Dakṣiṇāmnāya** (Southern) - Tripurasundarī and Shri Vidya

## Vaishnava Agamas (108 Texts)

**Two Main Schools**:

1. **Pancharatra Agamas** - Classified into three:
   - Divya (from Vishnu)
   - Munibhaashita (from sages)
   - Aaptamanujaprokta (from trustworthy men)

2. **Vaikhanasa Agamas** (28 texts) - From Vikhanasa Rishi to disciples:
   - 13 Adhikaras by Bhrigu
   - 8 Samhitas by Marichi
   - 3 Kandas by Kashyapa
   - 4 Tantras by Atri

## Historical Context

- **Chronology**: Unclear, but likely composed in 1st millennium CE
- **Evidence**: Epigraphical and archaeological evidence from 7th century CE (Pallava era)
- **Some scholars**: Suggest origins as early as 5th century BCE
- **Languages**: Sanskrit and Tamil

## Key Distinctions from Vedic Practice

| Aspect | Vedic | Agamic |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Worship** | Yajna (fire sacrifice), no icons | Puja (deity worship), icons and temples essential |
| **Focus** | Knowledge is salvation | Action and will drive practice |
| **Symbols** | Non-theistic paths alternative | Symbols, icons, temples necessary |

## Dialogical Structure

Agamas are structured as **dialogues between Shiva and Shakti**, contrasting with monologue revelation. This portrays spiritual insight as:
- Always ongoing
- Eternal and dynamic conversation
- Seekers can enter with right cultivation of awareness

## Temple Architecture

Agamas provide elaborate rules for:
- **Silpa** (sculpture art)
- Temple location and construction
- Image installation and materials
- Dimensions and proportions
- Air circulation and lighting
- Daily worship rituals

**Examples**: Shore Temple, Nataraja iconography

## Other Agamic Traditions

- **Ganapatya Agamas** - Focused on Ganesha
- **Kaumara Agamas** - Focused on Kartikeya/Murugan
- **Saura/Soura Agamas** - Focused on Surya (Sun)

## Quantification by Paramananda Tantra

- Vaishnava: 6,000 tantras
- Shaiva: 10,000 tantras
- Shakta: 100,000 tantras
- Ganapatya: 1,000 tantras
- Saura: 2,000 tantras
- Bhairava: 7,000 tantras
- Yaksha-bhutadi-sadhana: 2,000 tantras

**Total**: 128,000+ sectarian tantras (though many are lost or never composed)

---

**Key Insight**: The Agamic traditions represent the ritualistic, esoteric, and temple-based dimensions of Hinduism, complementing the philosophical and sacrificial focus of the Vedas. They are the practical manuals for worship, spiritual practice, and the construction of sacred space.
