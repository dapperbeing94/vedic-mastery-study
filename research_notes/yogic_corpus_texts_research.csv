"Hatha Yoga Pradipika - the classical manual of Hatha Yoga by Swatmarama, covering asanas, pranayama, mudras, and samadhi",Hatha Yoga Pradipika,"The Hatha Yoga Pradipika (HP) was composed by **Svātmārāma** (also spelled Swatmarama) in the **15th century CE** [1] [2]. Svātmārāma was a yogi of the **Nath Sampradaya** (lineage), a tradition founded by the legendary figure Matsyendranath [1]. The text explicitly traces its lineage back to the *Adinath* (Lord Shiva) and the *Siddhas* (perfected beings) like Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath, establishing a spiritual authority for the practices it describes [3]. The HP is considered a compilation of earlier Hatha Yoga teachings, drawing from various sources and presenting them in a structured manual [4]. The date of composition, generally accepted as the 15th century, places it in the medieval period, a time of significant development and codification of Hatha Yoga practices [1].","The Hatha Yoga Pradipika is a Sanskrit text organized into **four chapters** (Upadeśas), containing a total of approximately **389 verses** (*shlokas* or *sutras*) [10]. The structure is systematic, progressing from the physical preparations to the ultimate goal of *Samadhi*.

| Chapter ID | Chapter Title | Primary Focus | Verse Count (Approx.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | *Asana* (Postures) | Introduction, qualifications of a yogi, ethical conduct, and the practice of *asanas* for stability and health. | 67 |
| 2 | *Shatkarma* and *Pranayama* | The six purification techniques (*Shatkarma*) and various breath control practices (*Pranayama*) for purifying the *nadis* (energy channels). | 78 |
| 3 | *Mudra* and *Bandha* (Seals and Locks) | Detailed instructions on the ten *Mudras* and three *Bandhas* for awakening the *Kundalini* and achieving immortality. | 130 |
| 4 | *Samadhi* (Absorption) | The ultimate goal of Raja Yoga, describing the state of *Samadhi*, *Nada* (inner sound), and the dissolution of the mind. | 114 |

The text is composed in the style of a manual, using concise verses to describe the techniques, often requiring the guidance of a teacher for proper understanding and practice [9]. The sequential nature of the chapters emphasizes the progressive nature of the Hatha Yoga path [10].","The central philosophical concept of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika is that **Hatha Yoga is a preparatory step for Raja Yoga** (the ""Royal Yoga""), the ultimate goal of which is *Samadhi* (super-conscious state or meditative absorption) [5]. Svātmārāma states that Hatha Yoga is a ladder to Raja Yoga, and the two are inseparable: ""One cannot obtain perfection in Raja Yoga without Hatha Yoga, nor [perfection] in Hatha Yoga without Raja Yoga. So both should be practiced until success is attained"" (HP 4.3) [6]. The term *Haṭha* itself is often interpreted as the union of the sun (*Ha*, representing the *prana* or vital energy, and the *pingala* nadi) and the moon (*Tha*, representing the mind or *apana* and the *ida* nadi) [7]. The core teaching is the purification and control of the physical body and the vital energies (*prana*) to force the mind into a state of stillness, thereby awakening the *Kundalini* energy and leading it up the central channel (*Sushumna Nadi*) to achieve *Samadhi* [8]. The text emphasizes the importance of a proper environment, ethical conduct, and the guidance of a guru for success in practice [9].","The Hatha Yoga Pradipika details a six-fold path of practices, often referred to as the six limbs of Hatha Yoga, which are systematically presented across the four chapters [10]. These practices are designed to purify the body, control the breath, and seal the vital energy, all as a means to achieve the ultimate state of *Samadhi* [8].

| Practice | Sanskrit Term | Chapter | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Postures** | *Asana* | 1 | Focuses on a limited number of postures (e.g., 15 are mentioned, including *Siddhasana*, *Padmasana*, and *Vajrasana*), primarily for achieving steadiness, health, and lightness of the body [11]. |
| **Purification** | *Shatkarma* | 2 | Six cleansing techniques (e.g., *Dhauti*, *Basti*, *Neti*, *Trataka*, *Nauli*, and *Kapalabhati*) used to remove impurities and balance the *doshas* (humors) [12]. |
| **Breath Control** | *Pranayama* | 2 | Detailed instructions on various breathing techniques (e.g., *Surya Bhedana*, *Ujjayi*, *Sitali*, *Bhastrika*) to purify the *nadis* (energy channels) and awaken *Kundalini* [13]. |
| **Seals** | *Mudra* | 3 | Ten specific physical gestures (e.g., *Mahamudra*, *Khechari Mudra*, *Vajroli Mudra*) that are said to seal the *prana* and prevent its escape, leading to immortality [14]. |
| **Locks** | *Bandha* | 3 | Three internal energy locks (*Mula Bandha*, *Uddiyana Bandha*, *Jalandhara Bandha*) used in conjunction with *Pranayama* and *Mudras* to direct the *prana* into the *Sushumna Nadi* [15]. |
| **Absorption** | *Samadhi* | 4 | The final goal, described as the state of union and super-conscious awareness, achieved through the practices of Hatha Yoga [5]. |

The text places particular emphasis on *Pranayama* and *Mudras* as the most direct means to achieve the goal of *Samadhi* [14].","The Hatha Yoga Pradipika is arguably the most respected and referenced textual source of Hatha Yoga and holds immense historical and practical significance [20]. It is the text that effectively codified and systematized the disparate Hatha Yoga practices that had been developing in the preceding centuries, presenting them as a coherent system [1].

Its influence on **modern yoga** is profound, as it provides the foundational blueprint for the physical practices that define contemporary Hatha Yoga styles [21]. The emphasis on *asanas* and *pranayama* in the HP became the core of the modern physical yoga movement, even though the HP's original intent was to use these practices solely as a means to achieve *Samadhi* [22]. Many of the postures and breathing techniques taught in modern studios can be directly traced back to the HP, making it the backbone of most modern Hatha Yoga lineages [21].

Major commentaries on the text include the **Jyotsnā** commentary by **Brahmananda** (also known as Swami Brahmananda), which is widely regarded as one of the most important and is often included in modern translations [23]. Other significant commentaries and translations have been produced by various schools and scholars, such as those by Swami Muktibodhananda and B.K.S. Iyengar, each offering unique insights and interpretations of the terse Sanskrit verses [24]. The HP remains a living text, continually studied and reinterpreted by practitioners and scholars worldwide [1].","The Hatha Yoga Pradipika stands as a pivotal text that bridges the gap between the classical Raja Yoga of Patanjali's **Yoga Sutras** and the later, more physically-oriented Hatha Yoga texts [5]. While the HP acknowledges the ultimate goal of Raja Yoga, it shifts the focus from the mental and ethical restraints (*yama* and *niyama*) of the Yoga Sutras to the physical and energetic practices (*asana*, *pranayama*, *mudra*) [16].

It is considered the *locus classicus* (classical source) of premodern Hatha Yoga and is often grouped with two other major medieval texts: the **Gheranda Samhita** (17th century) and the **Shiva Samhita** (17th century) [17]. The HP is generally considered the oldest and most authoritative of these three, providing a more systematic and concise manual than the others [18]. It also draws heavily from earlier Tantric and Nath traditions, incorporating concepts like *Kundalini*, *Nadis*, and *Chakras* that are not explicitly detailed in the Yoga Sutras [19]. The HP's synthesis of these various traditions is what cemented its influence as the foundational text for subsequent Hatha Yoga lineages [1].",
"Gheranda Samhita - a comprehensive yoga text attributed to sage Gheranda, detailing the sevenfold path of yoga",Gheranda Samhita,"The Gheranda Samhita is presented as a dialogue between the sage **Gheranda** and his disciple, **King Chanda Kapali** (also referred to as Chandakapali). The text is not a historical record of a single author but a compilation of Hatha Yoga practices. It is considered a relatively late work on Hatha Yoga, with scholarly consensus placing its date of composition around the **late 17th century CE** (c. 1700 CE). This makes it roughly contemporaneous with the *Shiva Samhita*. The text is believed to have been composed in the **Bengal** region of India, as suggested by the location of most of its manuscripts and the first critical editions. Unlike the *Hatha Yoga Pradipika*, it does not explicitly trace a lineage of *Nath* yogis, but rather focuses on the practical instruction of *Ghatastha Yoga* (the yoga of the body-pot).","The *Gheranda Samhita* is structured as a dialogue between the preceptor, Sage Gheranda, and his disciple, Chanda Kapali. The text is divided into **seven chapters** (*Upadeshas*), corresponding to the seven limbs of *Ghatastha Yoga*.

*   **Total Verses**: The text contains approximately **351 *shlokas*** (verses), though the exact number may vary slightly between editions.
*   **Chapter Organization**: Each chapter is dedicated to one of the seven limbs, detailing the practices and their benefits:
    1.  ***Shatkarma*** (Purification)
    2.  ***Asana*** (Strengthening)
    3.  ***Mudra*** (Steadiness)
    4.  ***Pratyahara*** (Calmness)
    5.  ***Pranayama*** (Lightness)
    6.  ***Dhyana*** (Perception)
    7.  ***Samadhi*** (Isolation/Liberation)

The structure is highly systematic, presenting a step-by-step manual for the physical and spiritual development of the practitioner.","The central philosophical concept of the *Gheranda Samhita* is **Ghatastha Yoga**, which translates to ""the yoga of the body-pot."" The body (*ghata*) is viewed as an unbaked clay pot that must be purified and strengthened through yogic practices to achieve the ultimate goal of liberation (*moksha*). The text outlines a unique **sevenfold path (Saptanga Yoga)**, which is distinct from Patanjali's eight limbs (*Ashtanga Yoga*). The seven limbs are:

1.  ***Shatkarma*** (Purification): Cleansing the body.
2.  ***Asana*** (Strengthening): Gaining physical strength.
3.  ***Mudra*** (Steadiness): Cultivating mental and physical stability.
4.  ***Pratyahara*** (Calmness): Withdrawing the senses.
5.  ***Pranayama*** (Lightness): Achieving lightness of the body.
6.  ***Dhyana*** (Perception): Developing deep concentration.
7.  ***Samadhi*** (Isolation/Liberation): Attaining the state of liberation.

The text emphasizes the physical and physiological aspects of yoga as the necessary foundation for spiritual attainment, reflecting the broader Hatha Yoga tradition. The ultimate goal is the realization of the Self and the attainment of *Samadhi*, described as the state of *Manonmani* (mindlessness) or *Nirvikalpa Samadhi* (absorption without thought).","The *Gheranda Samhita* is highly practical and encyclopedic, detailing a vast number of techniques, particularly in the physical and purification categories.

*   ***Shatkarma*** **(Purification)**: Six cleansing actions are described, including *Dhauti* (internal cleansing), *Basti* (yogic enema), *Neti* (nasal cleansing), *Trataka* (gazing), *Nauli* (abdominal churning), and *Kapalabhati* (skull-shining breath).
*   ***Asana*** **(Postures)**: The text describes **32 asanas**, a number significantly higher than the 15 mentioned in the *Hatha Yoga Pradipika*. These include classic postures like *Siddhasana*, *Padmasana*, *Bhujangasana*, and *Mayurasana*.
*   ***Mudra*** **(Seals)**: **25 Mudras** are detailed, which are psycho-physical practices to seal the *prana* (life force) and direct energy. These include *Mahamudra*, *Khecarimudra*, *Vajrolimudra*, and various *Bandhas* (locks) like *Mula Bandha* and *Uddiyana Bandha*.
*   ***Pranayama*** **(Breath Control)**: **10 types of *Kumbhaka*** (breath retention) are described, such as *Suryabhedana*, *Ujjayi*, *Sitali*, and *Bhastrika*.
*   ***Dhyana*** **(Meditation)**: Three types of meditation are taught: *Sthula Dhyana* (gross/form meditation), *Jyotir Dhyana* (luminous/light meditation), and *Sukshma Dhyana* (subtle/formless meditation).

The text is particularly notable for its detailed and systematic presentation of the *Shatkarmas* and the large number of *asanas* and *mudras* it includes.","The *Gheranda Samhita* holds immense significance as one of the most comprehensive and encyclopedic manuals of Hatha Yoga. Its primary contribution is the systematic presentation of **Saptanga Yoga** (seven limbs), which provides a unique and detailed framework for practice centered on the concept of *Ghatastha Yoga*.

*   **Encyclopedic Nature**: It is celebrated for its extensive catalog of techniques, particularly the **32 *asanas*** and **25 *mudras***, which are more numerous than in other classical Hatha texts. This detail has made it an invaluable resource for scholars and practitioners seeking to understand the full breadth of pre-modern Hatha practices.
*   **Influence on Modern Yoga**: The text's emphasis on physical postures (*asanas*) and cleansing techniques (*shatkarmas*) has had a profound, though often indirect, influence on modern postural yoga. The detailed descriptions of *asanas* and *pranayama* have been incorporated into various modern yoga lineages, including those that emphasize physical culture and therapeutic applications.
*   **Major Commentaries**: Notable modern interpretations and commentaries have been provided by scholars and yogis, such as **Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati** of the Bihar School of Yoga, whose work has helped popularize the text and its practices in the contemporary era. The first critical edition was published by the Adyar Library in 1933.

The text's focus on the body as a vessel for spiritual transformation remains a core tenet of many contemporary Hatha Yoga schools.","The *Gheranda Samhita* is considered one of the three foundational texts of classical Hatha Yoga, alongside the **Hatha Yoga Pradipika** (c. 15th century) and the **Shiva Samhita** (c. 17th century).

*   **Distinction from *Hatha Yoga Pradipika***: The *Hatha Yoga Pradipika* describes a fourfold path (*Chaturanga Yoga*), while the *Gheranda Samhita* presents a sevenfold path (*Saptanga Yoga*). The *Gheranda Samhita* is more encyclopedic in its coverage of physical techniques, detailing 32 *asanas* compared to the *Pradipika's* 15. The *Pradipika* focuses on the *Raja Yoga* goal through *Hatha* as a means, while the *Gheranda Samhita* focuses on the purification and strengthening of the body as the primary vehicle for liberation.
*   **Relationship to *Shiva Samhita***: Both texts are roughly contemporaneous (late 17th century) and share a focus on a wide range of physical and energetic practices. However, the *Shiva Samhita* is more philosophical and presents a fivefold path, whereas the *Gheranda Samhita* is more practical and systematic with its sevenfold path.
*   **Relationship to *Patanjali's Yoga Sutras***: The *Gheranda Samhita* is a product of the Tantric and Hatha traditions, which evolved separately from the classical *Ashtanga Yoga* of Patanjali. While both aim for *Samadhi*, the *Gheranda Samhita* replaces Patanjali's first two limbs (*Yama* and *Niyama*) with the physical purification of *Shatkarma* and the strengthening of *Asana*, reflecting a shift in focus from ethical preparation to physical mastery.

The text's comprehensive nature has made it a key reference for understanding the evolution of Hatha Yoga practices.",
"Shiva Samhita - an ancient Sanskrit text on yoga, tantra, and philosophy attributed to Lord Shiva",Shiva Samhita,"The Shiva Samhita is a classical Sanskrit text on Yoga and Tantra, presented as a dialogue between the Hindu deity **Lord Shiva** and his consort **Goddess Parvati**. The author is **unknown**. Its date of composition is debated among scholars, generally placed in the late medieval period, between the **15th and 17th centuries CE**. Some scholars, like James Mallinson, suggest a date before 1500 CE, making it potentially one of the earliest Hatha Yoga texts to name and describe asanas.","The text is composed of approximately **650 verses** (depending on the edition) and is divided into **five chapters (Patalas)**:

1.  **Chapter I (Existence one only):** A philosophical treatise on the nature of reality, Advaita Vedanta, the importance of Yoga, and the rejection of various philosophical schools.
2.  **Chapter II (The Microcosm):** Describes the human body as a microcosm of the universe, detailing the **Nadis** (energy channels), the **Jivatma** (individual soul), and the location of the **Kundalini Shakti**.
3.  **Chapter III (On Yoga Practice):** Discusses the **Vayus** (vital airs), the role of the Guru, the four types of practitioners, and the various types of Yoga (Mantra, Hatha, Laya, Raja).
4.  **Chapter IV (Yoni-Mudra):** Focuses on **Mudras** and **Bandhas** (seals and locks) as methods for controlling Prana and achieving spiritual power.
5.  **Chapter V (Bhoga - Enjoyment):** Details the obstacles to yoga, the four types of yoga, the importance of diet, and the process of **meditation** leading to the highest state of realization.","The core philosophy of the Shiva Samhita is rooted in **Advaita Vedanta** (non-dualism) and **Tantra**. It asserts that **Jnana (Gnosis)** alone is eternal and the universe is an **illusion (Maya)** superimposed on the Universal Spirit (Paramatma). The text emphasizes that **all beings can attain liberation (Moksha)** through dedicated yoga practice, irrespective of caste or background. It integrates the concept of **Kundalini Shakti** as the dormant spiritual energy at the base of the spine, which is awakened through yogic practices to achieve enlightenment. The text also classifies practitioners into four types: **Arambhaka** (Beginner), **Ghata** (Intermediate), **Parichaya** (Advanced), and **Nishpatti** (Liberated).","The text provides detailed instructions on various Hatha Yoga practices, focusing heavily on **Pranayama** and the subtle body. It names **84 Asanas** but only describes a few in detail, such as *Siddhasana*, *Padmasana*, *Ugrasana*, and *Svastikasana*. Key practices include:

*   **Pranayama:** Considered critical for purifying the mind and activating the **Sushumna Nadi**. It describes techniques for breath control to awaken Kundalini.
*   **Mudras and Bandhas:** Techniques like *Mahamudra*, *Mahabandha*, *Mahavedha*, and *Vajroli Mudra* are described to control *prana* (vital energy) and direct it through the central channel.
*   **Kundalini Awakening:** The text details the subtle body, including the **350,000 Nadis** (energy channels), with a focus on the three main channels: *Ida*, *Pingala*, and *Sushumna*. The goal of practice is to awaken the Kundalini and guide it through the chakras.
*   **Meditation:** Emphasizes **meditation on the Self** to achieve inner stillness and ultimate realization.","The Shiva Samhita is historically significant as a foundational text of Hatha Yoga and Tantra. Its main contribution is its **democratic approach** to yoga, stating that liberation is accessible to all, which contrasts with the more restrictive traditions of the time. It is a key source for understanding the development of Hatha Yoga, particularly its integration of **Tantric concepts** like the subtle body, Kundalini, and Mudras. Its teachings, especially on Pranayama and the subtle body, have profoundly influenced modern yoga, with techniques like **Ujjayi Pranayama** being directly derived from its teachings. It was cited by influential figures like **Krishnamacharya**, whose teachings form the basis of many contemporary yoga styles.","The Shiva Samhita is considered one of the three most important classical texts of **Hatha Yoga**, alongside the *Hatha Yoga Pradipika* and the *Gheranda Samhita*. It is unique among these three for its strong emphasis on **Advaita Vedanta** philosophy and its more liberal view that all people, regardless of caste or creed, are eligible for liberation through Yoga. Unlike the *Hatha Yoga Pradipika*, which focuses more on physical practices, the Shiva Samhita provides a more comprehensive integration of **Tantra, philosophy, and subtle body anatomy**. It is also notable for its detailed description of the **Nadis** and the process of **Kundalini awakening**.",
"Goraksha Shataka (Goraksha Paddhati) - a foundational text of Hatha Yoga by Gorakhnath, describing asanas and practices",Goraksha Shataka (Goraksha Paddhati),"The **Goraksha Shataka** (also known as the **Goraksha Paddhati**) is traditionally attributed to the legendary sage **Gorakṣa** (Gorakhnath), the influential founder of the **Nath Hindu monastic movement** in India. Gorakṣa is considered one of the nine great saints, or **Navnath**, in a spiritual lineage that traces its origin to Shiva. The text is considered one of the earliest and most foundational texts of Haṭha Yoga, generally dated to the **11th or 12th century CE**, though some scholars place it as early as the 10th or as late as the 13th century. The text's lineage is firmly rooted in the **Nath Sampradaya** tradition.","The text is a concise work composed of approximately **100 verses** (*shlokas*), which is why it is called a *Shataka* (meaning ""a hundred""). It is also known as the *Goraksha Paddhati* (Goraksha's System or Path), which is sometimes considered a larger, related text, but the *Shataka* is the core hundred-verse work. The text is organized to systematically present the practices of Haṭha Yoga, detailing the **six limbs of yoga** (*Shadanga Yoga*): *asana*, *pranayama*, *pratyahara*, *dharana*, *dhyana*, and *samadhi*. The verses are highly technical and instructional, focusing on the practical steps and results of the yogic techniques.","The core philosophical concept of the *Goraksha Shataka* is the practical application of **Haṭha Yoga** for the purpose of spiritual liberation (*moksha*). It emphasizes the mastery of the physical body and vital energy (*prana*) as a prerequisite for higher states of consciousness. The text focuses on the concept of **Kundalini Shakti** and its awakening, stating in a significant verse: ""The coiled power (*Kundali Shakti*) is above the *kanda* (the root center). For Yogis, it is for liberation; for the deluded, it is for bondage. He who knows this is a knower of Yoga."" The text's teachings are centered on the idea that the physical practices of Haṭha Yoga are the means to control the mind and achieve *samadhi* (absorption). It details the **six limbs of yoga** (*Shadanga Yoga*), which include *asana*, *pranayama*, *pratyahara*, *dharana*, *dhyana*, and *samadhi*, providing a systematic path to spiritual realization.","The *Goraksha Shataka* is a practical manual that details specific techniques for the control of *prana* and the awakening of *Kundalini*. The key practices described include:

*   **Asanas (Postures):** The text mentions that there are 84 *asanas*, but specifically details only a few, with a strong emphasis on **Siddhasana** (the accomplished pose) as the most important. It also mentions **Gorakshasana**, a difficult seated posture named after the author.
*   **Pranayama (Breath Control):** The text places a strong emphasis on **Pranayama** as the primary means to purify the *nadis* (energy channels) and control the mind. A key practice is the cleansing of the *nadis* to ensure the free flow of *prana*, which is said to restrain the *prana* as desired, kindle the digestive fire, and allow the internal sound (*nada*) to be heard.
*   **Mudras and Bandhas (Seals and Locks):** The text describes five bodily *mudras* and three *bandhas* (energy locks) as essential for the unfolding of spiritual forces. The *bandhas* (Mula, Uddiyana, and Jalandhara) are crucial for directing *prana* upwards.
*   **Dharana (Concentration):** The text includes practices of *dharana* focused on the **Panchamahābhūtas** (five great elements), where the practitioner concentrates on the elemental qualities at specific energy centers.

The text is notable for being the first to teach a system of **Haṭha Yoga** that integrates these physical and energetic practices.","The *Goraksha Shataka* is of immense historical and practical significance as it is widely regarded as the **first text to systematically present the teachings of Haṭha Yoga**. Its importance lies in its shift in focus from the purely mental and meditative practices of classical Raja Yoga to the psycho-physical techniques of *asana*, *pranayama*, *mudra*, and *bandha*. This text effectively codified the practices that would become the foundation of all subsequent Haṭha Yoga traditions. Its influence is not limited to historical texts; it is the ultimate source for many of the physical and energetic practices that form the basis of **modern postural yoga**. The emphasis on breath control (*pranayama*) and the awakening of *Kundalini* through physical locks and postures continues to be a central theme in many contemporary yoga styles, making the *Goraksha Shataka* a vital link between ancient yogic philosophy and its modern global practice.","The *Goraksha Shataka* holds a pivotal position as one of the earliest and most influential texts of Haṭha Yoga, serving as a direct source for later, more comprehensive compilations. It is considered a precursor to the three most famous classical Haṭha Yoga texts:

*   **Hatha Yoga Pradipika (15th Century):** The *Hatha Yoga Pradipika* by Svātmārāma explicitly acknowledges the lineage of Gorakṣa and draws heavily from the *Goraksha Shataka* and other Nath texts. Many of the core concepts, such as the importance of *pranayama*, *mudras*, and *bandhas*, are elaborated upon in the *Pradipika*.
*   **Gheranda Samhita (17th Century):** This text also builds upon the foundational principles laid out in the *Goraksha Shataka*.
*   **Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati:** Another text attributed to Gorakṣa, which focuses more on the philosophical and metaphysical aspects of the Nath tradition, complementing the practical focus of the *Goraksha Shataka*.

The text's introduction of a systematic, six-limbed approach to Hatha Yoga marks a clear evolution from the eight-limbed system (*Ashtanga Yoga*) of Patanjali's *Yoga Sutras*, establishing a distinct and influential branch of yogic philosophy and practice. The text has been the subject of commentaries, such as the **Yoga-Tarangini**, which further solidify its importance within the tradition.",
Yoga Vasishtha - a philosophical text in the form of a dialogue between Sage Vasishtha and Lord Rama on the nature of reality and liberation,Yoga Vasishtha (also known as *Vasistha Yoga Samhita* or *Mokṣopāya*),"The text is traditionally attributed to **Maharishi Valmiki**, the author of the *Ramayana*. However, scholars suggest the text evolved over several centuries, with its composition dating between the **6th or 7th century CE** and the **14th century**. The core text (*Mokṣopāya*) is often placed in **Kashmir** around the **10th century CE**. The text is presented as a philosophical discourse between the sage **Vasishtha** and the young Prince **Rama**.","The complete text (*Bṛhat Yoga Vāsiṣṭha*) is one of the longest Hindu texts, said to contain over **29,000 verses** (or 32,000 in some traditions). It is organized into **six *Prakaraṇas*** (sections or books):
1.  **Vairagya-prakaranam** (Dispassion)
2.  **Mumukshuvayahara-prakaranam** (Behavior of the Seeker)
3.  **Utpatti-prakaranam** (Arising and Birth)
4.  **Sthiti-prakaranam** (Existence and Settling)
5.  **Upashama-prakaranam** (Tranquility)
6.  **Nirvana-prakaranam** (Liberation)
A shorter version, the *Laghu Yoga Vāsiṣṭha*, contains about **6,000 verses**.","The *Yoga Vasishtha* is a foundational text of **Advaita Vedanta** philosophy, emphasizing **non-duality** (*Advaita*) and the illusory nature of the world (*Māyā*). The core teaching is that the only reality is **Brahman** (Consciousness, the Absolute), and the world is a mere appearance, a projection of the mind, often described using the metaphor of a **dream** or a **magic show** (*Indrajāla*). It expounds a form of **Subjective Idealism** (*Dṛṣṭi-sṛṣṭi-vāda*), where perception precedes creation. A key concept is the paramount importance of **Self-Effort** (*Puruṣārtha*) over destiny (*daiva*) for achieving liberation (*moksha*). It also describes the state of the **liberated-while-living** (*Jīvanmukta*).","The path to liberation is primarily through **Jñāna Yoga** (the Yoga of Knowledge) and **Vairāgya** (Dispassion). Key practices include:
*   **Seven *Bhūmikās* (Stages of Knowledge):** A seeker must ascend seven stages of spiritual development, from *Śubhecchā* (longing for truth) to *Turīya-gā* (the fourth state/Liberation).
*   **Four Guardians of the Gate:** The cultivation of four virtues as prerequisites: *śama* (tranquility), *vicāra* (inquiry), *santoṣa* (contentment), and *sādhu-saṅga* (good company).
*   **Mind Control:** Practices involve the control of *prana* (life force) and the mind, leading to the concentration of consciousness. The text emphasizes **self-inquiry** (*vicāra*) and knowledge (*jñāna*) as the primary means to sever the root of the mind.","The *Yoga Vasishtha* is one of the most significant and influential texts in the tradition of **Advaita Vedanta** and **Jñāna Yoga**. It is revered for its profound philosophical depth, poetic language, and use of numerous illustrative stories (over 50) to explain complex concepts. Its teachings on **Self-Effort** (*Puruṣārtha*) are highly influential. The text's narrative structure, set within the familiar context of the *Ramayana*, made the lofty philosophical ideas of Advaita Vedanta accessible to a wider audience, contributing significantly to the popularization of non-dualistic thought.","The text is a core text of **Advaita Vedanta**, closely aligning with the teachings of Gaudapada and Adi Shankara, particularly in its emphasis on *Māyā* and the non-dual nature of Brahman. It is a highly **syncretic** work, incorporating elements from:
*   **Ramayana:** It is presented as a discourse within the *Ramayana* tradition.
*   **Yoga:** It systematizes yogic philosophy, particularly *Jñāna Yoga*.
*   **Kashmiri Shaivism (Trika):** It shows influences from the Trika school, emphasizing consciousness as the ultimate reality.
*   **Buddhism:** Scholars note the incorporation of Buddhist ideas on the nature of the mind and the illusory world.
Notable English translations include those by **Swami Venkatesananda Saraswati** and **Swami Jyotirmayananda**.",
