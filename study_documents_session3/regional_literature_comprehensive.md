## Ramcharitmanas (The Holy Lake of the Acts of Rama)

**Author/Tradition**: Goswami Tulsidas (c. 1511–1623 CE), a 16th-century Indian Bhakti poet in the Vaishnavite tradition, specifically the Rāmānandī Sampradāya.

**Historical Period**: Composition began in 1574 CE (Vikram Samvat 1631) in Ayodhya, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar.

### Core Teachings
The central teaching is the path of **Bhakti** (devotion) to **Rama**, who is presented not merely as a virtuous human hero (as in the Valmiki Ramayana) but as the Supreme Brahman, an incarnation of Vishnu. The text emphasizes the importance of **Dharma** (righteous conduct), **Maryada** (proper social and moral limits), and **Seva** (selfless service) as the means to attain spiritual liberation and a life of peace and fulfillment. It makes the complex philosophical ideas of the Vedas and Upanishads accessible to the common people through the vernacular Awadhi language.

### Key Concepts
Key concepts are often expressed through the narrative and poetic structure:\n- **Rāmacaritamānasa**: Literally 'Lake of the deeds of Rama,' symbolizing a purifying and spiritually nourishing body of water.\n- **Bhakti** (Devotion): The primary path to God-realization, characterized by pure, unwavering love for Rama.\n- **Dharma** (Righteousness): The moral and ethical foundation of the universe, exemplified by Rama's life.\n- **Maryada Purushottam** (The Ideal Man): An epithet for Rama, signifying his adherence to moral and social boundaries.\n- **Māyā** (Illusion): The power that conceals the true nature of reality, which Rama's grace helps to overcome.\n- **Satsang** (Company of the Holy): The importance of associating with saints and devotees for spiritual growth.

### Structure
The epic poem is divided into seven books or cantos, known as **Kandas** (or Sopans), each detailing a phase of Rama's life:\n1. **Bāl Kāṇḍ** (Childhood Episode)\n2. **Ayodhyā Kāṇḍ** (Ayodhya Episode)\n3. **Araṇya Kāṇḍ** (Forest Episode)\n4. **Kiśkindhā Kāṇḍ** (Kishkindha Episode)\n5. **Sundar Kāṇḍ** (Pleasant Episode)\n6. **Laṅkā Kāṇḍ** (Lanka Episode)\n7. **Uttar Kāṇḍ** (Later Episode)\nThe text is primarily composed in the **Chaupai** (quatrain) and **Doha** (couplet) meters, making it highly musical and memorable.

### Practical Applications
The text serves as a practical guide for ethical and spiritual living. Recitation and singing of the *Ramcharitmanas* (known as *Ramayan Path*) is a common spiritual practice, believed to purify the mind and grant merit. The stories and characters provide archetypes for ideal conduct, such as the ideal son (Rama), wife (Sita), brother (Lakshmana), and devotee (Hanuman). The teachings are applied to modern life for cultivating self-control, discipline, moral principles, and unwavering faith in the face of adversity.

### Key Verses/Passages
One of the most famous and frequently recited *Chaupais* (quatrains) is from the *Bāl Kāṇḍ*:\n\n**Awadhi (Devanagari):**\nमंगल भवन अमंगल हारी। द्रवहु सुदसरथ अजिर बिहारी॥\n\n**Transliteration:**\n*Maṅgala bhavana amaṅgala hārī. Dravahu sudasaratha ajira bihārī.* \n\n**English Translation:**\n'O abode of all blessings, dispeller of all misfortunes, O one who sports in the courtyard of Dasharatha, be gracious unto me.'\n\nAnother key verse, often used for spiritual protection, is from the *Sundar Kāṇḍ*:\n\n**Awadhi (Devanagari):**\nराम काज करिबे को आतुर। प्रभु चरित्र सुनिबे को रसिया॥\n\n**Transliteration:**\n*Rāma kāja karibe ko ātura. Prabhu caritra sunibe ko rasiyā.* \n\n**English Translation:**\n'You are eager to perform the work of Rama, and you delight in hearing the glories of the Lord.' (Addressed to Hanuman)

### Cross-References
The *Ramcharitmanas* is a retelling of the original Sanskrit epic, the **Valmiki Ramayana**. The key difference is that Tulsidas's version is written in the vernacular Awadhi language, making it accessible to the masses, and it strongly emphasizes the **Bhakti** aspect, portraying Rama as the Supreme Godhead (Brahman) from the very beginning. It is also deeply connected to the **Vedas** and **Upanishads**, as Tulsidas sought to simplify and popularize their philosophical truths. The text is a cornerstone of the **Bhakti Movement** and is often studied alongside other devotional texts like the **Bhagavata Purana**.

### Authoritative Sources
The research is synthesized from scholarly and authoritative sources, including:\n- Academic works on medieval Indian literature and the Bhakti movement.\n- Commentaries and translations by renowned scholars such as F.S. Growse and W.D.P. Hill.\n- Publications from the Gita Press, Gorakhpur, which is a major publisher of Hindu religious texts.\n- Reputable online encyclopedias and spiritual organizations dedicated to the study of the text.

## Jnanesvari (also Dnyaneshwari or Bhavartha Deepika)

**Author/Tradition**: Sant Dnyaneshwar (also known as Jnaneshwar or Jnanadev), a 13th-century Marathi saint and poet. The text is a foundational work of the **Varkari** *sampradaya* (tradition), a devotional movement centered on the worship of the deity Vithoba (a form of Vishnu/Krishna) in Maharashtra. Philosophically, it is rooted in **Advaita Vedanta** but presents a synthesis of the three paths to liberation (Karma, Jnana, and Bhakti).

**Historical Period**: Composed in **1290 CE** (13th century) in the Marathi language. Dnyaneshwar completed the work at the age of 15 or 16. This period marks a significant time in the development of regional devotional literature in India, preceding the major Bhakti movements in North India.

### Core Teachings
The *Jnanesvari* is a profound philosophical and spiritual treatise that presents a unique synthesis of the three paths to liberation (*margas*) expounded in the *Bhagavad Gita*: **Karma Yoga** (the path of action), **Jnana Yoga** (the path of knowledge), and **Bhakti Yoga** (the path of devotion). Dnyaneshwar emphasizes **Bhakti** as the most accessible and unifying path, integrating the principles of action and knowledge within a framework of intense, selfless devotion. Core teachings include:

*   **Synthesis of Paths**: The text argues that the three paths are not mutually exclusive but form a single, integrated spiritual discipline (*yoga*), with devotion as the central thread.
*   **Advaita Vedanta**: It expounds on the non-dualistic philosophy of Advaita, emphasizing the unity of the individual soul (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
*   **Importance of the Guru**: The text stresses the necessity of a spiritual teacher (*Guru*) for guidance on the path to self-realization.
*   **Equanimity and Detachment**: It elaborates on the concept of performing one's duties (*Karma*) without attachment to the results, leading to mental balance (*equanimity*).
*   **Mystical Experience**: It includes detailed descriptions of advanced yogic practices, including **Kundalini Yoga** and the experience of the mystic who achieves self-realization.

### Key Concepts
*   **Bhavartha Deepika** (भावार्थ दीपिका): The original name of the text, meaning "The Light that Illuminates the Meaning [of the *Gita*]."
*   **Ovi** (ओवी): The specific four-line metrical form of poetry used by Dnyaneshwar, which is a traditional Marathi verse form. The *Jnanesvari* contains approximately 9,000 *Ovis*.
*   **Varkari** (वारकरी): The devotional tradition (*sampradaya*) in Maharashtra for which the *Jnanesvari* is a foundational text.
*   **Prapatti** (प्रपत्ति): The concept of absolute surrender to the Divine, a key element of the Bhakti path emphasized in the text.
*   **Siddha** (सिद्ध): A perfected being or realized soul, whose characteristics and path are described in the commentary.
*   **Chidvilas** (चिद्विलास): The play or sport of Consciousness, a concept used to describe the manifestation of the universe.

### Structure
The *Jnanesvari* is structured as a comprehensive commentary on the **Bhagavad Gita**. It follows the *Gita*'s eighteen chapters (*Adhyayas*) sequentially, providing an elaborate exposition of each verse.

*   **Length**: The text is significantly longer than the *Gita*, comprising approximately **9,000 *Ovi*** verses (compared to the *Gita*'s 700 *shlokas*).
*   **Form**: It is written in the **Ovi** meter, a rhythmic, four-line verse form of Marathi poetry, which gives the text a unique lyrical quality.
*   **Content Flow**: Dnyaneshwar uses the *Gita*'s dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna as a foundation, but expands upon the themes with vivid imagery, metaphors, and personal mystical insights, effectively transforming the philosophical text into a devotional epic.
*   **Conclusion**: The work concludes with the famous **Pasayadan** (Prayer for Grace), a universal prayer for the welfare of the world, which is considered a literary and spiritual masterpiece.

### Practical Applications
The *Jnanesvari* provides a practical guide for spiritual seekers, making the abstract philosophy of the *Gita* accessible through relatable examples and the use of the vernacular Marathi language.

*   **Devotional Practice (Bhakti)**: It encourages the cultivation of intense, selfless devotion to the Divine (*Vithoba* in the Varkari context) as the primary means of purification and realization.
*   **Action in the World (Karma Yoga)**: It teaches seekers to perform their daily duties and social responsibilities with a spirit of detachment, offering the results to God, thereby transforming mundane life into a spiritual practice.
*   **Mindfulness and Contemplation (Dhyana Yoga)**: The text offers detailed instructions on meditation and concentration, guiding the practitioner toward inner stillness and the experience of the *Atman*.
*   **Ethical Living**: The emphasis on universal friendship (*maitri*) and the cessation of wickedness (*Pasayadan*) serves as a moral and ethical blueprint for social harmony and personal conduct.

### Key Verses/Passages
The *Jnanesvari* is a verse-by-verse commentary on the *Bhagavad Gita*. The work is famous for its *Pasayadan* (पसायदान), or "Prayer for Grace," which is the concluding prayer of the text, often recited independently for its universal appeal.

**Pasayadan (Concluding Prayer - Chapter 18, Verses 1794-1798)**

*   **Marathi (Ovi 1794):**
    *   आतां विश्वात्मकें देवें । येणें वाग्यज्ञें तोषावें ।
        तोषोनि मज द्यावें । पसायदान हें ॥
*   **Translation (Summary):**
    *   "Now, O God of the Universe, be pleased with this sacrifice of words. Being pleased, grant me this boon (Pasayadan)."

*   **Marathi (Ovi 1796):**
    *   जे खळांची व्यंकटी सांडो । तया सत्कर्मी रती वाढो ।
        भूतां परस्परे पडो । मैत्र जीवाचें ॥
*   **Translation:**
    *   "Let the wickedness of the wicked cease. Let them be drawn to good deeds. Let the bond of friendship prevail among all beings."

*   **Marathi (Ovi 1797):**
    *   दुरिताचें तिमिर जावो । विश्व स्वधर्म सूर्यें पाहो ।
        जो जे वांछील तो तें लाहो । प्राणिजात ॥
*   **Translation:**
    *   "Let the darkness of evil disappear. Let the universe behold the Sun of Self-Dharma (one's true nature). Let all beings obtain whatever they desire."

### Cross-References
The *Jnanesvari* is, first and foremost, a commentary on the **Bhagavad Gita**, which itself is a part of the epic **Mahabharata**. It is considered one of the three sacred books (*Prasthanatrayi*) of the **Bhagawata Dharma** in the Varkari tradition, alongside the *Eknathi Bhagawata* (by Eknath) and the *Tukaram Gaathaa* (by Tukaram). While rooted in the philosophy of the later Vedic texts, such as the **Upanishads** and the **Bhagavad Gita**, Dnyaneshwar's work is also noted for its unique poetic and devotional contribution to the Marathi language, making the ancient wisdom accessible to the common people. It draws heavily on the philosophical concepts of **Vedanta** and **Sankhya**.

## Tirukkural (திருக்குறள்)

**Author/Tradition**: Thiruvalluvar (Tamil poet and philosopher). The text belongs to the classical Tamil literary tradition (Sangam literature) and is often referred to as the "Tamil Veda" or a universal book of ethics.

**Historical Period**: The composition period is generally placed between the **1st century BCE and the 5th century CE**, corresponding to the post-Sangam period of Tamil literature. The most common scholarly consensus places it around the **2nd century CE**.

### Core Teachings
The Tirukkural is a comprehensive guide to ethical living, governance, and love, offering universal principles devoid of sectarian bias. Its core teachings are structured around the three goals of life: **Aram** (Virtue/Righteousness), **Porul** (Wealth/Governance/Material Life), and **Inbam** (Love/Pleasure). It emphasizes the importance of a righteous life (Aram) as the foundation for success in material life (Porul) and fulfillment in love (Inbam). Key virtues promoted include truthfulness, non-violence, gratitude, self-control, and compassion.

### Key Concepts
The text is structured around three primary concepts, which are the Tamil equivalents of the Sanskrit Purusharthas:

*   **Aram** (Tamil: அறம்): Virtue, Righteousness, Moral Conduct. Equivalent to **Dharma** (Sanskrit).
*   **Porul** (Tamil: பொருள்): Wealth, Material Prosperity, Governance, Political and Economic Life. Equivalent to **Artha** (Sanskrit).
*   **Inbam** (Tamil: இன்பம்): Love, Pleasure, Sensual Enjoyment. Equivalent to **Kama** (Sanskrit).

Other important concepts include **Ozhukkam** (Discipline/Propriety), **Seyal** (Action/Deed), and **Nadu** (Nation/State).

### Structure
The Tirukkural is a collection of **1,330 couplets (Kurals)**, each a concise two-line verse. The entire work is systematically divided into three major parts, or books, which correspond to the three goals of life:

1.  **Aram (Book of Virtue):** Consists of 38 chapters (380 couplets). It is subdivided into domestic virtue and ascetic virtue.
2.  **Porul (Book of Wealth/Governance):** Consists of 70 chapters (700 couplets). It covers kingship, administration, statecraft, justice, and social ethics.
3.  **Inbam (Book of Love):** Consists of 25 chapters (250 couplets). It deals with the various aspects of conjugal love and passion.

The chapters are further grouped into sections (Iyal), making the structure highly organized and didactic.

### Practical Applications
The Tirukkural serves as a practical manual for ethical and successful living in the world. For spiritual seekers, it provides a clear, non-dogmatic path to righteousness (Aram) that forms the basis for all other pursuits. It guides practitioners to:

1.  **Cultivate Universal Virtues:** Apply principles like non-killing, non-stealing, truthfulness, and compassion in daily life.
2.  **Engage Righteously in the World:** Pursue wealth and social life (Porul) through ethical means, ensuring that one's material success does not compromise moral integrity.
3.  **Achieve Inner Harmony:** By balancing virtue, wealth, and love, the seeker can achieve a state of inner harmony and fulfillment, which is a prerequisite for higher spiritual realization (Moksha, which is implied but not explicitly discussed in the text).
4.  **Practice Self-Control:** The text's emphasis on self-control, discipline, and avoiding harmful actions is directly applicable to yogic and meditative practices.

### Key Verses/Passages
The Tirukkural consists of 1,330 couplets (Kurals). A foundational verse is:

*   **Kural 1:**
    *   **Tamil:** அகர முதல எழுத்தெல்லாம் ஆதி
        பகவன் முதற்றே உலகு.
    *   **Transliteration:** *Akara muthala ezhuththellam Aadhi*
        *Bhagavan mudhattre ulagu.*
    *   **Translation:** "A is the first and source of all the letters. Even so is God Primordial is the first and source of all the world." (This verse is an invocation to the primal source of creation.)

*   **Kural 39 (On Education):**
    *   **Tamil:** கற்க கசடறக் கற்பவை கற்றபின்
        நிற்க அதற்குத் தக.
    *   **Translation:** "Learn thoroughly what should be learned, and then live up to what you have learned." (Emphasizes the practical application of knowledge.)

### Cross-References
The Tirukkural is widely considered the equivalent of the Vedas in the Tamil tradition, earning it the title **"Tamil Veda"** or **"Ulagapothumarai"** (Universal Veda). Its three-part structure (Aram, Porul, Inbam) is a direct parallel to the three of the four **Purusharthas** (goals of human life) in Sanskrit Vedic tradition: **Dharma** (Aram), **Artha** (Porul), and **Kama** (Inbam). The text is often seen as a distillation of the ethical wisdom found in the broader Hindu-Vedic philosophical framework, adapted for a universal, non-sectarian audience. Scholarly interpretations suggest its philosophical roots are also influenced by Jain and Buddhist ethical principles prevalent in the region at the time.

## Tevaram and Tirumurai - Tamil Shaiva devotional poetry

**Author/Tradition**: The **Tevaram** (first seven volumes of the Tirumurai) was composed by the three most prominent Shaiva Tamil saints, known as the **Nayanars**: **Thirugnana Sambandar** (volumes 1-3), **Thirunavukkarasar** or **Appar** (volumes 4-6), and **Sundarar** (volume 7). The entire collection, the **Tirumurai**, is a compendium of songs by various Nayanars. The tradition is **Tamil Shaivism**, and the texts form the canonical basis for the **Shaiva Siddhanta** school of philosophy in South India and Sri Lanka.

**Historical Period**: The hymns of the **Tevaram** were composed primarily in the **7th and 8th centuries CE**, during the Pallava period in South India. This period marks the height of the **Bhakti movement** in the Tamil region. The entire **Tirumurai** collection spans from the **6th to the 11th century CE**. The compilation of the first seven volumes (Tevaram) into the canonical collection was undertaken in the **10th century CE** by **Nambiyandar Nambi** under the patronage of the **Chola** emperor **Rajaraja I**.

### Core Teachings
The core teachings are rooted in the **Bhakti movement**, emphasizing intense, personal, and emotional devotion (**Bhakti**) to the Hindu god **Shiva**.
*   **The Supremacy of Shiva (Parashiva):** Shiva is portrayed as the ultimate reality, the source and end of all existence, often described with both fierce and compassionate attributes.
*   **The Path of Service (Charya) and Devotion (Bhakti):** The hymns stress the importance of selfless service, pilgrimage to Shiva temples (**Paadal Petra Sthalam**), and the continuous chanting of Shiva's names and glories as the primary means to attain liberation.
*   **The Concept of the Soul (Pasu) and Bondage (Pasam):** The philosophy implicitly follows the Shaiva Siddhanta doctrine of the three realities: **Pati** (God/Shiva), **Pasu** (the soul), and **Pasam** (bondage/impurity). The hymns are the soul's passionate cry to be freed from the bondage of *pasam* and united with *Pati*.
*   **Moral and Ethical Living:** The poems often contain strong moral injunctions, advocating for a life of virtue, non-attachment, and fearlessness. Appar's famous verse, "To none are we subject! Death we do not fear!" encapsulates this spirit of spiritual independence and courage derived from absolute surrender to Shiva.

### Structure
The text is organized into a twelve-volume compendium known as the **Tirumurai** (The Holy Way).
*   **Volumes 1-7 (Tevaram):** These form the core, containing 796 hymns (*pathikams*) with over 8,284 stanzas, composed by the three primary Nayanars: Sambandar (Vols. 1-3), Appar (Vols. 4-6), and Sundarar (Vol. 7).

*   **Pilgrimage (Tirtha Yatra):** The hymns serve as a guide and inspiration for pilgrimage to the **Paadal Petra Sthalam** (the 275 temples sung by the Nayanars), which are considered sacred and spiritually potent.
*   **Temple Worship (Kriya):** The hymns are integral to the daily and festival rituals in Tamil Shaiva temples, reinforcing the connection between the devotee, the temple, and the divine.
*   **Cultivating Fearlessness and Surrender:** The philosophical message encourages the spiritual seeker to cultivate a state of absolute surrender to Shiva, leading to fearlessness (*namanai anjom* - "death we do not fear") and a constant state of inner joy (*inbame ennallum* - "joy for us, joy day by day").
*   **Meditation on the Divine Form:** The vivid, poetic descriptions of Shiva's form (e.g., the crescent moon, the bull, the ash) serve as objects of meditation (*dhyana*) for the devotee.

### Cross-References
The Tirumurai is the canonical scripture of **Tamil Shaivism**, holding a status comparable to the **Vedas** and **Shaiva Agamas** in the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition.
*   **Vedas and Agamas:** The Tirumurai, particularly the **Tirumandiram** (10th Tirumurai), is considered to be the essence of the Shaiva Agamas, which are themselves considered a parallel revelation to the Vedas. The Tirumurai is often seen as the Tamil equivalent of the Sanskrit Vedic tradition for the Shaiva community.
*   **Vaishnava Counterpart:** The Tirumurai is the Shaiva counterpart to the **Nalayira Divya Prabandham**, the collection of hymns by the Vaishnava Alvars, which similarly forms the canonical basis for the Sri Vaishnava tradition. Both collections arose during the Bhakti movement in South India.
*   **Periya Puranam:** The 12th volume of the Tirumurai, the **Periya Puranam** by Sekkizhar, is a hagiography that details the lives of the 63 Nayanars, including the three authors of the Tevaram, thus serving as a historical and devotional context for the entire collection.
