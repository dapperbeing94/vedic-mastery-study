## Introduction

The ultimate goal of Hindu philosophy is moksha, or liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara). The various schools of thought and scriptures offer different paths to attain this goal, but they can be broadly categorized into three main yogas: Karma Yoga (the path of action), Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), and Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion). This document synthesizes the teachings on these paths from the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras, and the Upanishads.

## The Three Yogas of the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita provides a comprehensive synthesis of the three yogas, presenting them as interconnected paths to liberation.

### Karma Yoga: The Path of Action

Karma Yoga is the path of selfless action, performed without attachment to the fruits of the action. Krishna teaches Arjuna that one can achieve liberation by performing one's duties (dharma) in a spirit of detachment and offering the results to God. This purifies the mind and prepares it for the attainment of knowledge and devotion.

### Jnana Yoga: The Path of Knowledge

Jnana Yoga is the path of knowledge, which involves the intellectual understanding of the nature of the self (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). Through study, reflection, and meditation, the jnani (one who follows the path of knowledge) realizes the non-dual nature of reality and is liberated from the illusion of a separate self.

### Bhakti Yoga: The Path of Devotion

Bhakti Yoga is the path of loving devotion to a personal God. Krishna declares that this is the most direct and easiest path to liberation. The bhakta (devotee) engages in devotional practices such as chanting, worship, and service, and ultimately attains the supreme abode of the Lord through His grace.

## The Eight-Limbed Path of the Yoga Sutras

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali outline a systematic, eight-limbed path (Ashtanga Yoga) to liberation (kaivalya). This path is a form of Raja Yoga, or the "royal yoga," which emphasizes meditation and control of the mind.

### The Eight Limbs

1.  **Yama**: Ethical restraints (non-violence, truthfulness, etc.)
2.  **Niyama**: Ethical observances (purity, contentment, etc.)
3.  **Asana**: Physical postures
4.  **Pranayama**: Breath control
5.  **Pratyahara**: Withdrawal of the senses
6.  **Dharana**: Concentration
7.  **Dhyana**: Meditation
8.  **Samadhi**: Absorption

Through the practice of these eight limbs, the yogi stills the fluctuations of the mind and realizes the true nature of the self (Purusha) as distinct from matter (Prakriti).

## The Path of Knowledge in the Upanishads

The Upanishads primarily emphasize the path of Jnana Yoga. They teach that liberation is attained through the realization of the identity of the individual soul (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman). This is achieved through the process of **shravana** (hearing the scriptures), **manana** (reflecting on the teachings), and **nididhyasana** (meditating on the truth).

## Synthesis and Conclusion

While the different paths to liberation may seem distinct, they are ultimately interconnected and complementary. The Bhagavad Gita synthesizes the three yogas, showing how they can be practiced in an integrated manner. The Yoga Sutras provide a detailed methodology for the practice of meditation, which is a key component of all three paths. And the Upanishads provide the philosophical foundation for the path of knowledge.

Ultimately, the choice of path depends on the temperament and inclination of the individual seeker. Whether through action, knowledge, or devotion, the goal is the same: to transcend the limitations of the ego and to realize one's true nature as eternal, blissful consciousness.
