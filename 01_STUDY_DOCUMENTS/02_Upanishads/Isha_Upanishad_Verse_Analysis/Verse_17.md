## 💭 Commentary Summary

**Shankara's Commentary (Advaita Vedanta):** Shankara interprets this verse as a prayer made by a seeker at the time of death, who has performed both *Karma* (actions) and *Upāsanā* (meditation/worship) as prescribed in the Vedas. The prayer has two parts: 1) The dissolution of the physical body and the subtle body's ascent. The phrase *vāyur anilam amṛtam* is a prayer for the *Prāṇa* (vital breath/subtle body) to merge into the all-pervading, immortal cosmic Air (*Sūtrātman*), which is a step towards liberation. The phrase *athedaṃ bhasmāntaṃ śarīram* is a recognition that the gross body will be reduced to ashes. 2) The repeated invocation *oṃ krato smara kṛtaṃ smara* is a prayer to the mind (*Kratu*, meaning will or resolve) to remember all the good deeds (*Kṛtam*) and spiritual practices performed throughout life. This remembrance is crucial for determining the soul's trajectory after death, ensuring a favorable path (*Devayāna*) towards the realization of Brahman [1] [2]. **Other Commentaries (e.g., Swami Sivananda):** Swami Sivananda echoes the interpretation of the verse as a prayer of the dying man who has led a virtuous life. The remembrance of good deeds (*Kṛtam*) at the moment of death is seen as a means to attain bliss in the next world. He also notes that *Kratu* is sometimes interpreted as the sacrificial Fire (*Agni*) itself, or the mind, which is the seat of will and resolve [3]. **Sri Aurobindo's Interpretation:** Sri Aurobindo, while acknowledging the traditional view, offers a more psychological interpretation. He sees the verse as a statement of fact and a psychological process: the vital breath (*Prāṇa*) is an immortal life, while the physical body is mortal. The prayer is a call to the *Will* (*Kratu*) to remember its past actions, suggesting a continuity of consciousness and a final act of will to align with the immortal life [4].
