## 💭 Commentary Summary

Shankara's commentary interprets **Sambhūti** as an apheresis for **Asambhūti** (the unmanifested Prakriti or Avyakta) and **Vināśa** as the manifested effect, specifically **Hiranyagarbha** (Cosmic Intelligence or the first manifestation of Brahman). The verse, along with the preceding ones, is directed at those who seek gradual liberation (Krama-mukti) through a combination of worship (Upāsanā). The combined worship of the unmanifested (Asambhūti/Prakriti) and the manifested (Vināśa/Hiranyagarbha) is declared desirable. Through the worship of the manifested (Vināśa/Hiranyagarbha), one overcomes the defects of vice, desires, and limited powers (anaisvaryam), thereby conquering death. Through the worship of the unmanifested (Sambhūti/Prakriti), one attains immortality, which Shankara interprets as absorption into Prakriti (Laya) or the attainment of the highest state short of complete liberation (Moksha) which is achieved only through the knowledge of the Self (Ātman). The worship of either one alone leads to darkness, as stated in the preceding verses.
