## 💭 Commentary Summary

Adi Shankara's commentary identifies the subject of this verse as the **Sanyasin** (one who seeks liberation). The core of the commentary is the explanation of the two parts of the vision:
1.  **"Seeing all beings in his own Atman"**: This means realizing that all *Bhutas* (all created things, from the unmanifested *Avyakta* down to the immovable creation) are **not distinct from one's own Self** (Atman).
2.  **"Seeing his Atman in all beings"**: This means realizing that one's own Atman is the **Atman of all**. Just as the Atman is the pure, unconditioned witness and thinking principle of one's own body, it is the life principle of the entire universe.

The conclusion, **"he feels no revulsion (*vijugupsate*)"**, is the natural result of this realization. Revulsion or hatred arises only when one perceives something as separate and distinct from the Self. For the realized soul, who sees the pure, continuous Atman everywhere, there is no 'other' object to excite the feeling of disgust or fear [1] [2]. Swami Sivananda reinforces this, stating that this vision of the Atman as the common consciousness in all beings (king, peasant, ant, elephant) makes it absolutely impossible for the great soul to shrink from or dislike anyone [3].
