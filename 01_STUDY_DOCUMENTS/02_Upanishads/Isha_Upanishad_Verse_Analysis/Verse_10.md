## 💭 Commentary Summary

The verse states that the results obtained from **Vidya** (Knowledge) and **Avidya** (Ignorance) are distinct, a teaching received from the wise preceptors.

**Shankara's Commentary (Bhashya):**
Shankara interprets this verse, along with verses 9 and 11, as addressing those who are not yet qualified for the highest knowledge of Brahman (Nishtha). In this context, he defines:
*   **Vidya** as the knowledge of the deities, or Upasana (meditation/worship).
*   **Avidya** as ritualistic actions, or Karma.

According to Shankara, the distinct results are:
*   By pursuing **Vidya** (Upasana), one attains **Devaloka** (the world of gods).
*   By pursuing **Avidya** (Karma), one attains **Pitriloka** (the abode of the manes/forefathers).
The verse thus highlights that neither path alone leads to the ultimate goal of liberation (Moksha), but rather to temporary heavenly realms, setting the stage for the next verse which advocates for their combined pursuit [2].
