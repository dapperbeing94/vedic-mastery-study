## 💭 Commentary Summary

**Shankara's Commentary:** Shankara interprets this verse as a prayer made by a devotee who has performed both prescribed actions (*Karma*) and worshipped the lower Brahman (Hiranyagarbha or the manifested Brahman in the solar orb) throughout their life. The prayer is made at the time of death, seeking the path to the true Self (*Satya*). The "golden vessel" (*hiraṇmayena pātreṇa*) is the resplendent form of the manifested Brahman (Aditya/Sun), which covers the face (*mukham*) or entrance to the unmanifested, ultimate Truth. The devotee asks the Sun-God (Pūṣan) to remove this covering so that they, who have been devoted to the Truth (*satyadharmāya*), may behold the ultimate reality (*dṛṣṭaye*). This verse marks the transition from the path of action and worship of the manifested to the path of knowledge and renunciation, which leads to the highest result: the realization of the *Atman* in everything.
