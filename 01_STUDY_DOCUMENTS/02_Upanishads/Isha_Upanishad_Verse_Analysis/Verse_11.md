## 💭 Commentary Summary

**Adi Shankaracharya's Commentary (Advaita Vedanta Perspective):**
Shankara interprets **Vidya** as *Upāsanā* (meditation or worship of the deities) and **Avidya** as *Karma* (ritualistic action, such as Agnihotra). He emphasizes the doctrine of **Karma-Upāsanā Samuccaya**, the simultaneous pursuit of both action and worship by the same person.
*   By **Avidya** (Karma), one overcomes **Mrityu** (Death), which is interpreted as the bondage of action and knowledge induced by *Prakriti* (nature).
*   By **Vidya** (Upāsanā), one attains **Amritam** (immortality), which in this context means becoming one with the deities (*Sālokya, Sārūpya*, etc.), a form of relative immortality, not the ultimate non-dual Brahman.
The combination of the two gradually secures the desirable end of spiritual progress.

**Swami Sivananda's Commentary:**
Sivananda's interpretation aligns, stating that **Mrityu** (death) means work and worldly knowledge, and **Amritam** (immortality) is to have communication with the deities.
