## Introduction

In Chapter 16, Krishna describes the divine (daivi) and demonic (asuri) natures, outlining the qualities and characteristics of each. This chapter provides a clear moral framework for spiritual life, explaining the consequences of living a life of righteousness versus a life of ungodliness.

## Key Teachings

1.  **The Divine Qualities (Daivi Sampat)**: Krishna lists twenty-six divine qualities, including fearlessness, purification of one's existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity, and simplicity.
2.  **The Demonic Qualities (Asuri Sampat)**: Krishna describes the demonic qualities, which include pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, and ignorance. Those who possess the demonic nature do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. They are unclean, untruthful, and believe that the world is unreal, with no foundation and no God in control.
3.  **The Fate of the Demonic**: Krishna explains that those who are of a demonic nature are cast into the ocean of material existence, where they are born again and again in demonic species of life. They are the lowest of mankind, and they can never approach him.
4.  **The Three Gates to Hell**: Krishna identifies lust, anger, and greed as the three gates to hell. He urges Arjuna to abandon these three and to live a life regulated by the scriptures.
