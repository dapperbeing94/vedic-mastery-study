## Introduction

In Chapter 15, Krishna uses the metaphor of an upside-down banyan tree to describe the material world and explains how to extricate oneself from its entanglement. He then reveals his supreme position as Purushottama, the Supreme Person, who is transcendental to both the fallible (kshara) and the infallible (akshara) beings.

## Key Teachings

1.  **The Banyan Tree of the Material World**: Krishna compares the material world to a gigantic, upside-down banyan tree, with its roots upwards and its branches downwards. The Vedas are its leaves. This tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature, and its branches extend upwards and downwards, representing the different species of life. The only way to cut down this tree is with the weapon of detachment.
2.  **The Transmigrating Soul**: Krishna describes how the living entity in the material world carries its different conceptions of life from one body to another, just as the air carries aromas. The foolish cannot see how the soul quits its body, nor can they see what sort of body it enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature.
3.  **The Supreme Person (Purushottama)**: Krishna explains that there are two classes of beings: the fallible (kshara), which includes all beings in the material world, and the infallible (akshara), which includes all beings in the spiritual world. But beyond both is the Supreme Person, Purushottama, who is the Supersoul himself, the imperishable Lord who has entered the three worlds and is maintaining them.

## Key Themes

-   **Supreme Being**: The revelation of Krishna as the Supreme Person, transcendental to all.
-   **Material World**: The nature of the material world as an entanglement that must be cut with the weapon of detachment.
-   **Spiritual World**: The ultimate goal of attaining the spiritual world, from which one never returns.
-   **Ultimate Goal**: The understanding that Krishna is the ultimate goal of all Vedic knowledge.

## Key Verse

> "I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person." (BG 15.18)

## Commentarial Perspectives

-   **Shankara (Advaita)**: Shankara interprets the chapter as a guide to understanding the illusory nature of the material world and the ultimate reality of the non-dual Brahman. He sees the description of the Supreme Person as a way of pointing to the formless, attributeless Absolute.
-   **Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)**: Ramanuja sees the chapter as a confirmation of God
