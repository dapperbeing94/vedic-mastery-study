## Introduction

In Chapter 17, Arjuna asks Krishna about the status of those who worship with faith but do not follow the rules of the scriptures. Krishna responds by explaining that faith can be of three kinds, corresponding to the three modes of material nature. He then describes the three types of food, sacrifice, austerity, and charity, according to the three modes.

## Key Teachings

1.  **Three Types of Faith**: Krishna explains that faith can be in the mode of goodness (sattva), passion (rajas), or ignorance (tamas), according to one's nature. The worship of the demigods is in the mode of goodness, the worship of demons is in the mode of passion, and the worship of ghosts and spirits is in the mode of ignorance.
2.  **Three Types of Food**: Food also has three types. Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one's existence, and give strength, health, happiness, and satisfaction. Foods in the mode of passion are too bitter, too sour, too salty, too hot, or too pungent, and cause distress, misery, and disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance are stale, tasteless, decomposed, and putrid.
3.  **Three Types of Sacrifice**: Sacrifice performed according to the scriptures, as a matter of duty, without desire for reward, is in the mode of goodness. Sacrifice performed for some material benefit, or for the sake of pride, is in the mode of passion. Sacrifice performed without regard for the scriptures, without faith, and without the chanting of Vedic hymns, is in the mode of ignorance.
4.  **Three Types of Austerity**: Austerity of the body, speech, and mind can also be of three types. Austerity performed with faith, for the sake of the Supreme, is in the mode of goodness. Austerity performed for the sake of honor, respect, and veneration is in the mode of passion. Austerity performed out of foolishness, with self-torture, or for the purpose of destroying or injuring others, is in the mode of ignorance.
5.  **Three Types of Charity**: Charity given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy person, without expectation of return, is in the mode of goodness. Charity given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruitive results, or in a grudging mood, is in the mode of passion. Charity given at an improper time and place, to an unworthy person, without respect, or with contempt, is in the mode of ignorance.

## Key Themes

-   **Types of Faith**: The understanding that faith is not a monolithic concept, but can be influenced by the three modes of nature.
-   **Austerity, Charity, Sacrifice**: The analysis of religious and social activities according to the three modes.
-   **Three Modes**: The pervasive influence of the three gunas on all aspects of life.

## Key Verse

> "Worship of the demigods is for those in the mode of goodness; of the demons, for those in the mode of passion; and of the ghosts and spirits, for those in the mode of ignorance." (BG 17.4)

## Commentarial Perspectives

-   **Shankara (Advaita)**: Shankara interprets the chapter as a guide to cultivating sattvic qualities, which are conducive to the attainment of knowledge. He sees the different types of faith, food, and sacrifice as expressions of the three modes, which must be transcended to realize the non-dual Brahman.
-   **Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)**: Ramanuja sees the chapter as a guide to performing all activities in a way that is pleasing to God. He emphasizes that even those who cannot follow all the rules of the scriptures can make spiritual progress by acting in the mode of goodness and offering the results of their actions to God.
-   **Madhva (Dvaita)**: Madhva interprets the chapter as a confirmation of the hierarchical nature of souls. He maintains that the type of faith one has is determined by one's inherent nature, and that only those with sattvic faith can attain liberation.
