_part1", text="# Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 5: Renunciation of Action (Karma Sannyasa Yoga)

**Author**: Manus AI
**Date**: November 22, 2025

## Introduction

In Chapter 5, Arjuna again questions Krishna about the two paths of action (Karma Yoga) and renunciation of action (Karma Sannyasa). Krishna clarifies that both paths lead to liberation, but the path of selfless action is superior and easier to practice for most people. He explains that true renunciation is not the giving up of action itself, but the renunciation of the desire for the fruits of action.

## Key Teachings

1.  **Karma Yoga and Sannyasa**: Krishna explains that both the yoga of action and the renunciation of action lead to the highest good. However, of the two, the yoga of action is superior. A true sannyasi (renunciate) is one who neither hates nor desires, and is free from the pairs of opposites.
2.  **The Nature of the Self**: A wise person understands that the self does nothing. While the body, mind, and senses are engaged in action, the soul remains a detached witness.
3.  **The Abode of Brahman**: One who is unattached to external sense pleasures and finds happiness within the self is united with Brahman and enjoys eternal bliss.
4.  **The Vision of Equality**: A truly learned person sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater. This is because they see the same divine spirit in all beings.

## Key Themes

-   **True Renunciation**: The internal renunciation of the fruits of action, rather than the external abandonment of action.
-   **Inner Detachment**: The ability to remain detached from the actions of the body and mind.
-   **Equanimity**: The state of being free from the pairs of opposites, such as pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor.
-   **Peace**: The ultimate goal of spiritual practice, which is attained through self-control and inner detachment.

## Key Verse

> "One who performs their duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water." (BG 5.10)

## Commentarial Perspectives

-   **Shankara (Advaita)**: Shankara emphasizes that true sannyasa is the renunciation of the sense of doership, which arises from the realization of the non-dual nature of the self. He sees Karma Yoga as a means to purify the mind and prepare it for this ultimate realization.
-   **Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)**: Ramanuja interprets the chapter as a confirmation that Karma Yoga, when performed as a loving service to God, is a direct path to liberation. He sees no conflict between action and devotion.
-   **Madhva (Dvaita)**: Madhva highlights the importance of understanding that God is the ultimate controller of all actions and that the individual soul is merely an instrument. He sees the chapter as a guide to performing one's duties with this understanding.
