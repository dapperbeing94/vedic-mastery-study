## Introduction

The Bhagavad Gita, or "Song of God," is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata. It is a dialogue between the prince Arjuna and his charioteer, the god Krishna, on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The Gita presents a synthesis of Hindu ideas about dharma, theistic bhakti, and the yogic paths to moksha (liberation).

## Core Philosophy

The central philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita is the reconciliation of the paths of **Karma Yoga** (the yoga of selfless action), **Jnana Yoga** (the yoga of knowledge), and **Bhakti Yoga** (the yoga of devotion). Krishna teaches Arjuna that one can achieve liberation by performing one's duties without attachment to the fruits of action, with a mind fixed on the divine.

## Structure

The Bhagavad Gita is composed of 18 chapters, which are traditionally divided into three sections of six chapters each:

| Section | Chapters | Yoga | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | 1-6 | Karma Yoga | The Path of Action |
| **II** | 7-12 | Bhakti Yoga | The Path of Devotion |
| **III** | 13-18 | Jnana Yoga | The Path of Knowledge |

## Commentarial Traditions

The Bhagavad Gita has been interpreted by the three major schools of Vedanta philosophy:

-   **Adi Shankaracharya (Advaita Vedanta)**: Emphasizes Jnana Yoga and the non-dual identity of the soul and Brahman.
-   **Ramanujacharya (Vishishtadvaita Vedanta)**: Emphasizes Bhakti Yoga and the qualified non-dualism of the soul and a personal God.
-   **Madhvacharya (Dvaita Vedanta)**: Emphasizes Bhakti Yoga and the eternal dualism of the soul and a personal God.
