## Philosophical and Moral Teachings

### 1. Dharma (Righteousness and Duty)

**Central Theme:** The Rāmāyaṇa is fundamentally about dharma - how to live righteously in complex situations

**Rāma as Dharma Embodied:**
- Unwavering commitment to duty as son, husband, and king
- Prioritizes righteousness over personal desire
- Makes difficult choices that honor dharma even at great personal cost
- Known as "Maryādā Puruṣottama" (Perfect Man who never transgresses limits)

**Types of Dharma Illustrated:**
- **Putra Dharma** (Duty as Son): Accepts exile to honor father's promise
- **Pati Dharma** (Duty as Husband): Protects and rescues Sītā
- **Rāja Dharma** (Duty as King): Banishes Sītā when subjects question her purity (controversial)
- **Bhrātṛ Dharma** (Duty as Brother): Bharata's loyalty, Lakṣmaṇa's devotion

**Dharma Conflicts:**
- Personal desire vs duty to father (Rāma chooses duty)
- Love for wife vs duty to subjects (Rāma's tragic choice)
- Individual happiness vs collective welfare
- Truth vs compassion

### 2. Bhakti (Devotion)
