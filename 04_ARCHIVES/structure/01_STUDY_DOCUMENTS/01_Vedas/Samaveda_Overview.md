## Introduction

The Samaveda, the "Veda of Melodies," is the third of the four Vedas and serves as a liturgical text for the *Udgātar* priests. It is a collection of 1,875 verses, almost all of which are drawn from the Rigveda, but arranged and set to music for chanting during the Soma sacrifices. The Samaveda is the foundation of Indian classical music and is revered for its emphasis on the spiritual power of sound.

## Core Philosophy

The core philosophy of the Samaveda centers on the transformative power of sound (*Nada*) and melody (*Sāman*). The correct chanting of the *Sāman* is believed to be a direct means of connecting with the divine and realizing the ultimate reality, Brahman. The philosophical essence of the Samaveda is most profoundly articulated in the **Chāndogya Upaniṣad**, which contains the famous *Mahāvākya* (Great Saying): **"Tat Tvam Asi"** (Thou Art That).

## Structure

The Samaveda is organized into two main parts:

| Part | Sanskrit Name | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Part I** | **Ārcika** | A collection of 1,875 verses (*Ṛc*), organized by deity. |
| **Part II** | **Gāna** | The melodies and chants (*Sāman*) to which the verses are sung. |

## Key Verses

The significance of the Samaveda lies in its musical settings rather than the originality of its verses. The following are key verses and philosophical statements from the Samaveda and its associated Upanishads:

| Sanskrit | Transliteration | Translation | Source/Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ॐ | Om | The primordial sound, the essence of all Vedas. | Universal Mantra |
| अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवं ऋत्विजम्। | Agnim īḷe purohitaṃ yajñasya devaṃ ṛtvijam. | I laud Agni, the chosen priest, god, minister of sacrifice. | Samaveda, Purvārcika, 1.1.1 |
| तत्त्वमसि | Tat Tvam Asi | Thou Art That. | Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7 |
| सर्वे खल्विदं ब्रह्म | Sarvaṃ khalv idaṃ brahma | All this, indeed, is Brahman. | Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1 |
