## Introduction

The Rigveda is the oldest and most important of the four Vedas, the foundational scriptures of Hinduism. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the Rigveda is a collection of 1,028 hymns (sūktas) organized into ten books (maṇḍalas). It is a vast repository of ancient Indian wisdom, containing hymns of praise, prayers, philosophical inquiries, and mythological narratives. The Rigveda is considered a śruti text, meaning "what is heard," and is believed to be of divine origin, revealed to ancient sages (ṛṣis).

## Core Philosophy

The philosophy of the Rigveda is complex and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and practices. Key philosophical themes include:

-   **Cosmic Order (Ṛta)**: The concept of a natural, moral, and cosmic order that governs the universe.
-   **Deities (Devas)**: A pantheon of deities representing natural forces and cosmic principles, including Indra (king of the gods), Agni (the fire god), and Soma (a sacred plant and drink).
-   **Sacrifice (Yajña)**: The central ritual practice of the Vedic religion, through which humans communicate with the gods and maintain cosmic order.
-   **Cosmological Speculation**: Profound inquiries into the origin of the universe, as seen in hymns like the Nāsadīya Sūkta and the Puruṣa Sūkta.

## Structure

The Rigveda is organized into ten maṇḍalas, each with a varying number of hymns. The maṇḍalas are not arranged chronologically but are organized based on the families of ṛṣis who are said to have composed them.

| Maṇḍala | Hymns | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 191 | A collection of hymns from various ṛṣis. |
| 2-7 | 43-75 | The "family books," each attributed to a specific family of ṛṣis. |
| 8 | 103 | A collection of hymns from various ṛṣis. |
| 9 | 114 | Hymns dedicated to Soma, the sacred plant and drink. |
| 10 | 191 | A collection of later hymns, including many of the most philosophical and speculative ones. |

## Key Hymns

The Rigveda contains many famous and influential hymns, including:

-   **Nāsadīya Sūkta (10.129)**: The "Hymn of Creation," which speculates on the origin of the universe from a state of non-existence.
-   **Puruṣa Sūkta (10.90)**: The "Hymn of the Cosmic Person," which describes the creation of the universe from the sacrifice of the cosmic being, Puruṣa.
-   **Gāyatrī Mantra (3.62.10)**: One of the most famous and revered mantras in Hinduism, a prayer to the sun god Savitṛ.
