**Author**: Manus AI

## Introduction

The Atharvaveda is the fourth and final Veda, a collection of 730 hymns and 6,000 verses organized into 20 books (*Kāṇḍas*). It is a unique text that bridges the gap between the ritualistic focus of the other Vedas and the philosophical inquiries of the Upanishads. The Atharvaveda is a rich source of information about the daily life, popular beliefs, and medical practices of the Vedic period.

## Core Philosophy

The philosophy of the Atharvaveda is a blend of popular religion and metaphysical speculation. It introduces the concept of **Brahman** as the ultimate reality and the creator of the world, a theme that would become central to the Upanishads. The Atharvaveda also contains hymns dedicated to the healing of diseases, the attainment of prosperity, and the protection from evil spirits.

## Structure

The Atharvaveda is organized into 20 books, with the hymns arranged by length. The text is broadly divided into two categories:

-   **Atharvan**: Hymns and spells for healing and auspicious purposes.
-   **Aṅgirasa**: Hymns and spells for sorcery and hostile magic.

## Key Hymns

The Atharvaveda contains many hymns that are still recited today for various purposes:

-   **Prithvi Sūkta (12.1)**: A beautiful hymn in praise of the Earth, which is seen as a divine mother.
-   **Skambha Sūkta (10.7)**: A philosophical hymn that explores the nature of Brahman as the cosmic pillar that supports the universe.
-   **Sāṁmanasya Hymn (3.30)**: A hymn for promoting harmony and concord.
