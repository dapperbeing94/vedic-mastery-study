# Dharmasastras - Comprehensive Study

## **Yājñavalkya Smṛti** (याज्ञवल्क्य स्मृति)

**Author/Tradition**: The text is named after the revered Vedic sage **Yajnavalkya** (याज्ञवल्क्य), a prominent figure in the Upanishads (like the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad). However, the Smriti itself was composed centuries after the sage's lifetime, and is a key work within the **Dharmaśāstra** tradition. It is often associated with the Mithila region of ancient India. The most influential commentary on the text is the **Mitākṣarā** by **Vijñāneśvara** (11th-12th century CE), which became a foundational legal authority in much of India.

**Historical Period**: The text is generally dated between the **3rd and 5th century CE**, placing its composition firmly within the **Gupta period** (c. 320 to 550 CE), a time often referred to as the "Golden Age" of India. Scholar Patrick Olivelle suggests a more specific dating of the **4th to 5th century CE**. This period saw a flourishing of systematic legal and philosophical literature, which is reflected in the text's organized and systematic approach to law.

### Core Teachings
The **Yājñavalkya Smṛti** is a comprehensive treatise on **Dharma** (righteous conduct, duty, law), aiming to provide a systematic and practical guide for individuals and society. Its core teachings are structured around the three pillars of Hindu life:
1.  **Āchāra (Conduct):** Detailed rules for daily life, rituals, sacraments (*saṃskāras*), duties of the four social classes (*varṇas*), and stages of life (*āśramas*).
2.  **Vyavahāra (Law and Justice):** A highly systematic and influential code of civil and criminal law, covering judicial procedure, evidence, and eighteen titles of dispute (e.g., debt, theft, inheritance). It is considered more liberal and humane than the Manusmriti in its legal theories.
3.  **Prāyaścitta (Penance and Expiation):** Guidelines for atonement and purification for various sins and transgressions, linking ethical behavior to spiritual merit.
The text emphasizes the plurality of Dharma, drawing from multiple sources including the Vedas, Smritis, righteous conduct, and self-satisfaction.

### Key Concepts
The text is a repository of key Dharmaśāstra concepts, including:
*   **Dharma** (धर्म): The central concept, encompassing cosmic order, duty, law, and righteous conduct.
*   **Vyavahāra** (व्यवहार): The entire system of civil and criminal law, judicial procedure, and legal disputes. The text is particularly noted for its systematic treatment of this subject.
*   **Āchāra** (आचार): The code of conduct, customs, and rituals governing daily life and social interaction.
*   **Prāyaścitta** (प्रायश्चित्त): Expiation or penance for sins and transgressions, linking legal and ethical violations to spiritual purification.
*   **Mitākṣarā** (मिताक्षरा): The name of the most important commentary on the text, which became a school of Hindu law, particularly known for its doctrine of **coparcenary** (joint ownership of ancestral property by male family members).
*   **Varna-Āśrama Dharma** (वर्ण-आश्रम धर्म): The duties prescribed for the four social classes (*varṇas*) and the four stages of life (*āśramas*), which form the foundation of the text's ethical and social framework.

### Structure
The **Yājñavalkya Smṛti** is a concise and highly systematic text consisting of approximately **1,010 *ślokas*** (verses) composed in the *śloka* (poetic meter) style. It is notably shorter and more organized than the Manusmṛti. The text is divided into three main sections, or **Kāṇḍas** (Books):
1.  **Āchāra Kāṇḍa (Code of Conduct):** The longest section, containing **368 verses**. It deals with customs, rituals, duties of the student and householder, marriage, funeral rites, and the duties of the king.
2.  **Vyavahāra Kāṇḍa (Code of Law and Justice):** The most famous section, containing **307 verses**. It provides a detailed and systematic treatment of civil and criminal law, judicial procedure, evidence, and the eighteen titles of dispute.
3.  **Prāyaścitta Kāṇḍa (Code of Penance and Expiation):** Containing **335 verses**. It discusses various sins and the corresponding rites and penances required for purification and atonement.

### Practical Applications
The **Yājñavalkya Smṛti** has had profound and long-lasting practical applications, primarily in the field of Hindu law.
*   **Foundation of Hindu Law:** The text, particularly through the **Mitākṣarā** commentary, served as the primary source of personal law (especially inheritance and property rights) for the majority of Hindus across India for centuries, until the codification of Hindu law in the mid-20th century.
*   **Judicial System:** The *Vyavahāra Kāṇḍa* provided a systematic framework for judicial procedure, including rules of evidence, witnesses, and legal proceedings, influencing the administration of justice in various ancient and medieval Indian kingdoms.
*   **Ethical and Social Guidance:** The *Āchāra Kāṇḍa* and *Prāyaścitta Kāṇḍa* provided the ethical and moral foundation for the conduct of individuals, families, and communities, guiding rituals, duties, and atonement practices.
*   **Scholarly Study:** Today, it remains a critical text for scholars studying ancient Indian jurisprudence, social history, and the evolution of Dharmaśāstra literature.

### Key Verses/Passages
One of the most important verses, often cited as the opening of the text, sets the scene for the sage Yajnavalkya to deliver his teachings:

**Verse 1.1 (Āchāra Kāṇḍa):**
> योगीश्वरं याज्ञवल्क्यं संपूज्य मुनयो ऽब्रुवन् ।
> वर्णाश्रमेतराणां नो ब्रूहि धर्मान् अशेषतः ॥
>
> **Transliteration:** *Yogīśvaraṃ Yājñavalkyaṃ saṃpūjya munayo 'bruvan |*
> *Varṇāśrametarāṇāṃ no brūhi dharmān aśeṣataḥ ||*
>
> **Translation:** "Having duly honored the Lord of Yogis, Yājñavalkya, the sages said: 'Please tell us in full the laws (Dharmas) for the *Varṇas* (classes), the *Āśramas* (stages of life), and others.'"

This verse establishes the text's purpose as a comprehensive discourse on Dharma for all sections of society. Another notable section is the detailed discussion on the **eighteen titles of dispute** (*Vyavahāra*), which forms the backbone of the legal section.

### Cross-References
The **Yājñavalkya Smṛti** is situated in the Dharmaśāstra tradition and frequently references and builds upon earlier works, most notably the **Manusmṛti** (or **Mānava-Dharmaśāstra**). It is considered a refinement and systematization of the legal theories found in Manu, often paraphrasing or quoting passages while offering a more concise and logical structure. It also shares legal concepts with the **Nāradasmṛti**. Its most significant cross-reference is its own commentary, the **Mitākṣarā** by Vijñāneśvara, which became the basis for the **Mitākṣarā school of Hindu law**, governing inheritance and property rights across most of India until the 20th century. This commentary itself cross-references numerous other Smritis and legal texts.

## Nāradasmṛti (नारदस्मृति) or Nāradīya Dharmaśāstra (नारदीय धर्मशास्त्र)

**Author/Tradition**: Attributed to the divine sage **Nārada** (the messenger of the gods), who is portrayed as an instructor of law and politics. Scholarly consensus suggests there was no single author, but rather a compilation by an individual or group within the **Dharmaśāstra** tradition, who attributed the work to Nārada to enhance its authority.

**Historical Period**: The text is generally dated between **100 BCE and 400 CE**. This places it in the post-Mauryan and early Gupta periods, a time of significant development in Hindu legal thought. The oldest of the three recensions, the *Nāradīyamanusaṃhitā*, is considered to be the earliest version.

### Core Teachings
The *Nāradasmṛti* is a purely **juridical** text, focusing exclusively on **procedural and substantive law** (*vyavahāra*). It is unique among the *Dharmaśāstras* for omitting sections on righteous conduct (*ācāra*) and penance (*prāyaścitta*). Its primary purpose was to serve as a practical guide for rulers and their judicial systems in administering justice and maintaining social order, making it the "juridical text par excellence" of the tradition. It emphasizes the importance of evidence, witnesses, and judicial procedure.

### Key Concepts
- **Vyavahāra (व्यवहार):** Law, legal procedure, and judicial administration. The text is almost entirely devoted to this.
- **Vyavahārapada (व्यवहारपद):** The eighteen titles of law, which form the structural basis of the text. These cover all aspects of civil and criminal law.
- **Ṛṇādāna (ऋणादान):** The law concerning the recovery of debts, which is the first and most detailed title of law.
- **Dharma (धर्म):** Righteousness, duty, and law. The text is a part of the *Dharmaśāstras* and aims to uphold *dharma* through a just legal system.
- **Sāhasa (साहस):** Violence, assault, and criminal offenses.
- **Vākpāruṣya (वाक्पारुष्य) and Daṇḍapāruṣya (दण्डपारुष्य):** Verbal and physical assault, respectively.
- **Strīpuṃsayoga (स्त्रीपुंस्-योग):** Laws concerning marriage and the relationship between men and women.

### Structure
The text is structured into two main parts:
1.  **Mātṛkā (Prolegomena):** A brief introduction dealing with the court (*sabhā*), the judge (*prāḍvivāka*), the plaintiff (*bhāṣā*), and the reply (*uttara*).
2.  **Vyavahārapada (The 18 Titles of Law):** The main body, which is divided into chapters, each devoted to one of the eighteen titles of law. These titles cover civil and criminal matters, including:
    *   **Ṛṇādāna** (Recovery of Debt)
    *   **Nikṣepa** (Deposits)
    *   **Sambhūyasamutthāna** (Partnership)
    *   **Strīpuṃsayoga** (Marriage and Conjugal Relations)
    *   **Dāyabhāga** (Inheritance)
    *   **Sāhasa** (Violence/Assault)
    *   **Vākpāruṣya** (Verbal Assault)
    *   **Daṇḍapāruṣya** (Physical Assault)
    *   **Prakīrṇaka** (Miscellaneous)

The text exists in three recognized recensions, with the most common version containing around 1028 verses.

### Practical Applications
The *Nāradasmṛti* was a foundational text for the administration of justice in ancient and medieval India, particularly for the royal courts. Its detailed focus on legal procedure made it a practical manual for judges (*prāḍvivāka*) and legal practitioners. It was authoritative not only in the Indian subcontinent but also in parts of Southeast Asia (e.g., the Champa empire). In modern times, it is a crucial source for understanding the historical development of Hindu law, particularly in areas like contract law, debt, and judicial process, and is studied by legal historians and scholars of jurisprudence.

### Key Verses/Passages
The text is known for its practical maxims on evidence and judicial conduct.

**On the Authority of the King and the Law:**
> "The king is the fountain of justice, and the law is the basis of his authority. The king who administers justice according to the law is worthy of all praise." (Approximate translation of a core sentiment)

**On the Importance of Evidence:**
> "A king should decide cases on the basis of evidence, and not on the basis of his own opinion. Evidence is of three kinds: document, witness, and possession." (Paraphrased from the *Vyavahārapada* section)

**On the Role of the Judge (from the *Sabha* section):**
> "The judges should inspire awe in the witness by citing moral precepts which should uphold the majesty of truth and condemn falsehood." (As quoted in scholarly sources)

### Cross-References
The text is closely linked to the **Manusmṛti**, as its structure is based on the **eighteen titles of law** (*vyavahārapada*) mentioned in the *Manusmṛti*. One recension mythologically claims that the *Nāradasmṛti* is an abridgment of the ninth chapter (on legal procedure) of Manu's original text. It is also mentioned alongside the *Bhārgavīya* in a 12th-century inscription from the Champa empire, indicating its widespread authority. It is a later and more specialized development within the broader **Dharmaśāstra** literary tradition.

## Parāśara Smṛti (पराशर स्मृति) or Parāśara Dharma Saṃhitā

**Author/Tradition**: Attributed to Maharishi Parāśara (पराशर), the grandson of Vasishtha and father of Vyasa. It is a Dharmaśāstra text.

**Historical Period**: The exact date is uncertain, but it is considered a later Smriti, post-dating Manusmriti and Yajnavalkya Smriti. Scholarly estimates often place the final compilation between 100 CE and 500 CE, or even later, as it is specifically designed for the Kali Yuga.

### Core Teachings
The primary teaching is the concept of **Yuga Dharma** (the law/duty appropriate for the age), asserting that the rules of conduct (Dharma) must change with the changing times. It is explicitly declared as the **Dharmaśāstra for the Kali Yuga** (the current age of moral decline). Its purpose is to provide adaptable, compassionate, and practical guidelines for householders (Gṛhastha) to maintain righteousness in a difficult age, focusing heavily on expiation (Prayaścitta) for sins.

### Key Concepts
1. **Yuga Dharma (युग धर्म):** The central concept that rules of law and conduct differ from age to age (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali). 2. **Prayaścitta (प्रायश्चित्त):** Expiation or penance for sins, which is a major focus of the text, reflecting the difficulty of maintaining purity in Kali Yuga. 3. **Ācāra (आचार):** Rules of good conduct, cleanliness, and daily rites, particularly for the householder. 4. **Atithi Devo Bhava (अतिथि देवो भव):** The injunction to treat a guest as God, emphasized in the text as a key duty for the householder in Kali Yuga.

### Structure
The text is generally divided into **twelve chapters (Adhyāyas)**. The structure follows the traditional Dharmaśāstra pattern, but with a strong emphasis on the second section. The two main parts are: 1. **Ācāra-khaṇḍa (आचार खण्ड):** Deals with rules of conduct, daily duties, and the duties of the householder. 2. **Prayaścitta-khaṇḍa (प्रायश्चित्त खण्ड):** Deals extensively with expiations and penances for various sins and transgressions, which forms the bulk of the text.

### Practical Applications
The text is considered the most relevant and authoritative Dharmaśāstra for Hindus in the present age (Kali Yuga). It is used to determine appropriate religious and social conduct, especially concerning purification rites and penances. Its emphasis on compassion and adaptability over rigid adherence to older, stricter laws (like those of Manu) makes it a foundational text for modern Hindu practice, particularly in matters of ritual purity and atonement.

### Key Verses/Passages
1. **Yuga Dharma Verse (Chapter 1, Verse 22):**\n    > कृते तु मानवा धर्मास्त्रेतायां गौतमाः स्मृताः।\n    > द्वापरे शाङ्खलिखिताः कलौ पाराशराः स्मृताः॥\n    > **Translation:** The laws of Manu are suited for the Krita Yuga; those of Gautama for the Treta Yuga; those of Śaṅkha and Likhita for the Dvapara Yuga; and those of **Parāśara for the Kali Yuga**.\n2. **Change in Gift-Giving (Chapter 1, Verse 28):**\n    > कृते सम्भाषणाद्दानं त्रेतायां दर्शनं स्मृतम्।\n    > द्वापरे स्पर्शनं दानं कलौ तु सेवादानं स्मृतम्॥\n    > **Translation:** In Krita, a gift is made through mere conversation; in Treta, through sight; in Dvapara, through touch; but in **Kali, a gift is made in exchange for service rendered**

### Cross-References
The text is presented as a conversation between **Vyāsa** and his father, **Parāśara**, where Vyāsa explicitly mentions having heard the laws of other sages. It directly references and supersedes the Dharmaśāstras of **Manu (Manusmṛti)**, **Gautama**, **Śaṅkha**, and **Likhita** by declaring them unsuitable for the Kali Yuga. It is often studied alongside the **Yājñavalkya Smṛti** and is part of the larger body of **Smṛti** literature.
