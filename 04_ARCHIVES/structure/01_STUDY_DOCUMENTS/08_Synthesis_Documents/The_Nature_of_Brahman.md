## Introduction

The concept of Brahman is the cornerstone of Hindu philosophy, representing the ultimate, unchanging reality that is the source of all existence. This document synthesizes the teachings on the nature of Brahman from the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the common threads and the different perspectives offered by the major schools of Vedanta.

## Brahman in the Upanishads

The Upanishads, which form the philosophical core of the Vedas, are the primary source of knowledge about Brahman. They describe Brahman in both its transcendent (nirguna) and immanent (saguna) aspects.

### Nirguna Brahman: The Formless Absolute

The Upanishads often describe Brahman as being beyond all attributes, names, and forms. It is the formless, attributeless, and absolute reality that is the ground of all being. The **Mandukya Upanishad** describes the fourth state of consciousness (turiya) as being "unseen, transcendent, the sole essence of the consciousness of the one Self, the cessation of the universe, peaceful, blissful, and non-dual."

### Saguna Brahman: The Personal God

The Upanishads also describe Brahman as a personal God, the creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe. The **Svetasvatara Upanishad** speaks of a personal God who is the Lord of all, the knower of all, and the inner controller of all beings.

### The Mahavakyas: The Great Sayings

The Upanishads contain several "great sayings" (mahavakyas) that encapsulate the non-dual nature of Brahman and the individual soul (Atman). The most famous of these is **"Tat Tvam Asi"** (Thou Art That) from the **Chandogya Upanishad**, which asserts the fundamental identity of the individual soul with Brahman.

## Brahman in the Brahma Sutras

The Brahma Sutras, attributed to the sage Badarayana, systematize the teachings of the Upanishads and establish Brahman as the central theme of Vedanta. The first four sutras, known as the **Chatuhsutri**, lay out the entire framework:

1.  **Athato Brahma Jijnasa**: Now, therefore, the inquiry into Brahman.
2.  **Janmadyasya Yatah**: Brahman is that from which the origin, sustenance, and dissolution of the world proceed.
3.  **Sastra-Yonitvat**: Brahman is known because it is the source of the scriptures.
4.  **Tat Tu Samanvayat**: That Brahman is to be known from the scriptures because it is consistently taught therein.

The Brahma Sutras also defend the Vedantic view of Brahman against rival philosophical systems, such as the Sankhya and Vaisheshika schools.

## Brahman in the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita presents a synthesis of the Upanishadic teachings on Brahman, with a strong emphasis on the personal aspect of God. Krishna reveals himself as the Supreme Brahman, the source of all, and the ultimate object of devotion.

### The Universal Form

In Chapter 11, Krishna reveals his universal form (Vishvarupa) to Arjuna, a magnificent and terrifying vision that encompasses the entire universe. This vision demonstrates Krishna's supreme power and his identity with the ultimate reality.

### The Three Yogas

The Gita teaches that Brahman can be realized through three paths:

-   **Karma Yoga**: The path of selfless action, performed without attachment to the fruits.
-   **Jnana Yoga**: The path of knowledge, which involves the intellectual understanding of the nature of Brahman.
-   **Bhakti Yoga**: The path of devotion, which involves the loving surrender to a personal God.

## Commentarial Perspectives

The different schools of Vedanta have interpreted the nature of Brahman in different ways:

-   **Advaita Vedanta (Shankara)**: Brahman is the only reality, and the world is an illusion (maya). The individual soul is identical with Brahman, and liberation is the realization of this non-dual identity.
-   **Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (Ramanuja)**: Brahman is a personal God (Vishnu) who is qualified by the attributes of the individual souls and the material world. The soul is a part of Brahman, but not identical with it.
-   **Dvaita Vedanta (Madhva)**: Brahman (Vishnu) is a personal God who is eternally distinct from the individual souls and the material world. Liberation is the attainment of a state of eternal service to God.

## Conclusion

The concept of Brahman is a profound and multifaceted one, with different scriptures and philosophical schools offering different perspectives. However, they all agree that Brahman is the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, and the ultimate goal of all spiritual practice. Whether conceived as a formless Absolute or a personal God, the realization of Brahman is the key to liberation from the cycle of birth and death and the attainment of eternal bliss.
