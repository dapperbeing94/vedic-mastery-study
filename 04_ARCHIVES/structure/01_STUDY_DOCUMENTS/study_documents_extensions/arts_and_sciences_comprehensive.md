## **Nāṭya Shāstra** (नाट्य शास्त्र / *Nāṭyaśāstra*)

**Author/Tradition**: The *Nāṭyaśāstra* is traditionally attributed to the sage (**Rishi**) **Bharata Muni** (also simply Bharata) [1]. However, scholarly consensus suggests it is the work of multiple authors or a school of thought compiled over centuries [2]. The text belongs to the Hindu tradition, specifically the genre of *Śāstra* (treatise or manual) [1]. It is often revered as the **Fifth Veda** (*Natya Veda*), a concept mentioned within the text itself (1.14–15), signifying its comprehensive and sacred status in the performing arts [3]. The text is a foundational work for all subsequent Indian performing arts traditions.

**Historical Period**: The text's composition spans a long period, with estimates ranging from **500 BCE to 500 CE** [1]. Most scholars agree that the first complete compilation of the *Nāṭyaśāstra* was likely finished between **200 BCE and 200 CE** [2]. This places it in the post-Vedic and early classical Sanskrit literature period. The text's content, which includes a mix of poetic verses and prose, suggests it was expanded and interpolated between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE, leading to various recensions [2]. The surviving version is generally considered to have been established by the 8th century CE [2].

### Core Teachings
The *Nāṭyaśāstra* is an encyclopedic treatise on the theory and practice of the performing arts, encompassing drama (*nāṭya*), dance (*nṛtta* and *nṛtya*), and music (*saṅgīta*) [1]. Its core teaching is the **Rasa Theory** (*rasa-siddhānta*), which posits that the primary goal of performance is to evoke a specific aesthetic experience (*rasa*, meaning "flavor" or "essence") in the spectator [4]. This experience is achieved through the combination of *bhāvas* (emotions or psychological states) [5]. The text details the four types of *Abhinaya* (acting/communication): *Āṅgika* (body movements), *Vācika* (speech), *Āhārya* (costume and make-up), and *Sāttvika* (involuntary expression of emotion) [1]. It also provides detailed instructions on dramaturgy, stagecraft, musicology, and prosody, aiming to transport the audience to a parallel reality for spiritual and moral reflection [4].

### Key Concepts
| Sanskrit Term (IAST) | Devanagari | Meaning/Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rasa** | रस | "Flavor," "essence," or "aesthetic sentiment." The emotional experience evoked in the audience. The text defines eight primary *rasas* (e.g., *Śṛṅgāra* - Erotic, *Raudra* - Furious, *Karuna* - Pathetic). |
| **Bhāva** | भाव | "Emotion," "mood," or "psychological state." The emotions portrayed by the actor that lead to the experience of *rasa*. The text lists 49 *bhāvas* (8 *Sthāyī*, 33 *Vyabhicārī*, 8 *Sāttvika*). |
| **Abhinaya** | अभिनय | "Communication" or "acting." The fourfold technique of conveying the dramatic meaning: *Āṅgika* (body), *Vācika* (speech), *Āhārya* (costume), and *Sāttvika* (involuntary emotion). |
| **Nāṭya** | नाट्य | "Drama" or "theatrical performance." Encompasses the entire spectrum of the performing arts, including dance, music, and drama. |
| **Tāṇḍava** | ताण्डव | A vigorous, masculine form of dance, traditionally associated with the god Shiva. |
| **Lāsya** | लास्य | A gentle, graceful, and feminine form of dance, traditionally associated with the goddess Parvati. |

### Structure
The *Nāṭyaśāstra* is a massive text, consisting of approximately **6,000 poetic verses** (*ślokas*) and is structured into **36 chapters** [1]. The text is presented as a dialogue between the sage Bharata and a group of other sages [2]. The chapters cover a vast range of subjects in a systematic manner:
*   **Chapters 1–5:** Origin of *Nāṭya*, construction of the playhouse (*nāṭyamaṇḍapa*), and preliminary rites (*pūrvaraṅga*).
*   **Chapters 6–7:** The core aesthetic theory: *Rasa* (aesthetic experience) and *Bhāva* (emotions).
*   **Chapters 8–13:** Techniques of acting (*Abhinaya*), including body movements (*Āṅgika*), hand gestures (*hastas*), and gaits (*cārīs*).
*   **Chapters 14–20:** Dramaturgy, including speech (*Vācika*), styles (*vṛttis*), plot structure, and character types.
*   **Chapters 21–27:** Costume, make-up (*Āhārya*), and the representation of different types of characters.
*   **Chapters 28–34:** Musicology (*Saṅgīta*), covering instrumental music, vocal music, rhythm, and musical instruments.
*   **Chapters 35–36:** Distribution of roles and the conclusion of the treatise [2].

### Practical Applications
The *Nāṭyaśāstra* remains the primary theoretical source for all major forms of Indian classical dance, music, and theatre [6].
*   **Classical Dance:** Forms such as **Bharatanatyam**, **Kathakali**, **Odissi**, **Kuchipudi**, and **Mohiniyattam** draw their fundamental techniques, hand gestures (*mudrās*), body postures (*karaṇas*), and aesthetic principles directly from the *Nāṭyaśāstra* [6].
*   **Music:** The text's detailed discussion of musical scales (*grāmas*), modes (*mūrcchanās*), and instruments laid the groundwork for both **Hindustani** and **Carnatic** classical music traditions [1].
*   **Modern Theatre and Cinema:** The *Rasa* theory is still used as a framework for dramatic composition, character development, and aesthetic criticism in contemporary Indian theatre and cinema [6].
*   **Academic Study:** It is a central text in the academic study of Indology, Sanskrit literature, and performance studies worldwide, providing a window into ancient Indian culture and aesthetics [1].

### Key Verses/Passages
The most famous passage from the *Nāṭyaśāstra* is the definition of *Nāṭya* as the Fifth Veda, which outlines its purpose and comprehensive nature [3].

**Verse 1.14–15 (The Creation of the Fifth Veda)**

> **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> **जग्राह पाठ्यं ऋग्वेदात् सामभ्यो गीतमेव च ।**
> **अभिनयान् यजुर्वेदात् रसानथर्वणादपि ॥**
>
> **IAST Transliteration:**
> *Jagrāha pāṭhyaṃ ṛgvedāt sāmabhyo gītameva ca.*
> *Abhinayān yajurvedāt rasānatharvaṇādapi.*
>
> **Translation:**
> **"He (Brahma) took the recitation (*pāṭhya*) from the *Rigveda*, and the song (*gīta*) from the *Sāmaveda*.**
> **The acting (*abhinaya*) from the *Yajurveda*, and the aesthetic experience (*rasa*) from the *Atharvaveda*."**

This verse establishes the divine and comprehensive source of *Nāṭya*, synthesizing the essential elements of the four Vedas into a single, complete art form [3].

**Verse 6.31 (The Rasa Sutra)**

> **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> **विभावानुभावव्यभिचारिसंयोगाद् रसनिष्पत्तिः ॥**
>
> **IAST Transliteration:**
> *Vibhāvānubhāva-vyabhicāri-saṃyogād rasa-niṣpattiḥ.*
>
> **Translation:**
> **"Rasa is produced from the combination of *Vibhāva* (determinants), *Anubhāva* (consequents), and *Vyabhicāri Bhāva* (transitory states)."**

This is the foundational statement (*sūtra*) of the Rasa Theory, which was later elaborated upon by Abhinavagupta in his *Abhinavabhāratī* [5].

### Cross-References
The *Nāṭyaśāstra* is a pivotal text that connects to numerous other works in the Hindu tradition [1].
*   **Vedas:** The text claims to be the **Fifth Veda** (*Natya Veda*), drawing elements from the four Vedas: *pathya* (recitation) from the *Rigveda*, *gīta* (song) from the *Sāmaveda*, *abhinaya* (acting) from the *Yajurveda*, and *rasa* (aesthetic experience) from the *Atharvaveda* [3].
*   **Secondary Literature:** It inspired the 10th-century commentary, the **Abhinavabhāratī**, written by the Kashmiri Śaivite philosopher **Abhinavagupta**, which is considered the most authoritative and influential exegesis of the text [1].
*   **Poetics and Aesthetics:** Its *Rasa* theory is foundational to all subsequent Indian poetics and aesthetics, influencing works like the *Dhvanyāloka* by Ānandavardhana.
*   **Puranas:** Chapters on dramatic arts and poetry in the *Agni Purana* follow the *Nāṭyaśāstra*'s format, indicating its widespread acceptance and influence [2].
*   **Earlier Works:** The text's roots are traced back to the earlier *Naṭasūtras*, which are mentioned in the works of the grammarian Pāṇini (c. 500 BCE) [2].

## संगीतरत्नाकर (Saṃgītaratnākara)

**Author/Tradition**: The *Saṃgītaratnākara* was composed by **Śārṅgadeva** (शार्ङ्गदेव), also known as Sarangadeva, in the 13th century CE (c. 1210–1247 CE). He hailed from a Kashmiri Brahmin family but served as a court scholar and physician (*Ayurveda*) to King Singhana of the Yadava dynasty in Devagiri (modern Daulatabad, Maharashtra). The text is not a product of a single, isolated tradition but rather a grand synthesis of the musicological knowledge that preceded it, drawing heavily from the traditions of the *Nāṭya Śāstra* and the *Bṛhaddeśī*. This position as a comprehensive compendium makes it a foundational text for the subsequent development of both North and South Indian classical music traditions.

**Historical Period**: The *Saṃgītaratnākara* is dated to the first half of the **13th century CE** (c. 1210–1247 CE). This period is historically significant as it immediately precedes the major political and cultural shifts brought about by the Islamic conquest in the Deccan region of India. Consequently, the text is invaluable as a comprehensive document of the state of Indian music and dance just before the traditions began to diverge into the distinct Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic (South Indian) systems. It represents the culmination of the ancient and early medieval musicological thought, acting as a crucial historical and theoretical link between the classical traditions of the past and the regionalized traditions that would flourish in the post-13th century era.

### Core Teachings
The central teaching of the *Saṃgītaratnākara* is its comprehensive definition of **Saṃgīta** (संगीत) as the composite art form encompassing **Gītam** (vocal music), **Vādyam** (instrumental music), and **Nṛtyam** (dance). This definition, encapsulated in a key verse, establishes the encyclopedic scope of the work. The text systematically covers all aspects of music theory and practice, beginning with the metaphysical and physical origins of sound (*Nāda*), the system of microtones (*Śruti*), and notes (*Svara*). It then delves into the intricate structures of melodic modes (*Rāga*), rhythmic cycles (*Tāla*), and the ultimate aesthetic goal of performance, the emotional aesthetic (*Rasa*). As a pivotal "bridge text," it preserves and synthesizes the knowledge from earlier works, serving as the common theoretical ancestor for the later, distinct Hindustani and Carnatic music systems.

### Key Concepts
| Sanskrit Term (IAST) | Devanagari | Meaning/Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Saṃgīta** | संगीत | The composite art of vocal music, instrumental music, and dance. |
| **Gītam** | गीतम् | Vocal music or song. |
| **Vādyam** | वाद्यम् | Instrumental music. |
| **Nṛtyam** | नृत्यम् | Dance, or rhythmic movement. |
| **Nāda** | नाद | The fundamental concept of sound, often described as the source of all musical notes. It is divided into *āhata* (struck/audible) and *anāhata* (unstruck/subtle). |
| **Śruti** | श्रुति | Microtones, the smallest perceptible interval of pitch. The text discusses 22 *śrutis* within an octave. |
| **Svara** | स्वर | Musical note, derived from *śrutis*. The seven notes are *ṣaḍja*, *ṛṣabha*, *gāndhāra*, *madhyama*, *pañcama*, *dhaivata*, and *niṣāda*. |
| **Rāga** | राग | Melodic mode or framework, a set of rules for building a melody, which evokes a specific emotion (*Rasa*). |
| **Tāla** | ताल | Rhythmic cycle or meter. The text provides a detailed classification of *tālas*. |
| **Rasa** | रस | Aesthetic emotion or sentiment, which is the ultimate goal of the performance. |

### Structure
The *Saṃgītaratnākara* is a vast treatise organized into seven chapters, a structure that gives it the alternate name **Saptādhyāyī** (Seven Chapters), containing approximately 1,678 verses. The chapters are logically arranged to cover the entire spectrum of *Sangita*: **Chapter 1, *Svarāgata-adhyāya***, deals with the foundational elements of sound (*Nāda*), microtones (*Śruti*), and notes (*Svara*), uniquely including a section on the human body's connection to musical sound. **Chapter 2, *Rāga-viveka-adhyāya***, classifies and discusses the melodic structures (*Rāgas*). **Chapter 3, *Prakīrṇaka-adhyāya***, covers miscellaneous aspects of performance, including the qualities of performers and audience. **Chapter 4, *Prabandha-adhyāya***, details the structure and types of musical compositions. **Chapter 5, *Tāla-adhyāya***, is a comprehensive treatise on rhythmic cycles. **Chapter 6, *Vādya-adhyāya***, classifies and describes musical instruments (*Vādyas*) into four categories: *tata* (stringed), *suṣira* (wind), *avanaddha* (percussion), and *ghana* (solid). Finally, **Chapter 7, *Nartana-adhyāya***, is dedicated to the theory and practice of dance (*Nṛtyam*), including gestures and the expression of emotions.

### Practical Applications
The *Saṃgītaratnākara* remains a text of immense practical and academic importance in the modern era. It is considered the most authoritative musicological text of the medieval period and serves as a common theoretical reference point for both the **Hindustani** (North Indian) and **Carnatic** (South Indian) classical music traditions, which trace their theoretical lineage back to its principles. Modern musicologists, performers, and scholars utilize the text to trace the historical evolution of *Rāgas* and *Tālas*, providing a crucial theoretical and historical basis for contemporary practice. Furthermore, the detailed **Nartana-adhyāya** (Chapter on Dance) is a significant source for the history and theory of Indian classical dance forms, aiding in the understanding of the transition from the ancient *Nāṭya Śāstra* tradition to the later regional styles. It is a primary text for academic research, offering a detailed snapshot of the performing arts in 13th-century India.

### Key Verses/Passages
The most frequently cited and foundational verse of the *Saṃgītaratnākara* is the one that defines the scope of the entire treatise:

> **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> गीतं वाद्यं तथा नृत्यं त्रयं सङ्गीतमुच्यते ।

> **IAST Transliteration:**
> *Gītaṃ vādyaṃ tathā nṛtyaṃ trayaṃ saṅgītamucyate.*

> **Translation:**
> "Song, instrumental music, and dance—these three are called *Sangita*."

This verse, found in the introductory section, establishes *Sangita* not merely as music but as a holistic performing art, justifying the text's comprehensive coverage of all three elements in its seven chapters.

### Cross-References
The *Saṃgītaratnākara* is a work of synthesis, and as such, it frequently references and builds upon the concepts of earlier musicological and performance texts. Most notably, it draws extensively from the **Nāṭya Śāstra** (c. 200 BCE – 200 CE) by Bharata Muni, particularly in its treatment of *Rasa* (aesthetic emotion), *Bhāva* (expression), and the theory of *Nṛtyam* (dance). Furthermore, the text incorporates and expands upon the ideas presented in the **Bṛhaddeśī** (c. 9th century CE) by Matanga Muni, especially in its discussion of *Rāgas* and the concept of *Deśī* (regional) music, which marked a significant evolution from the older *Mārga* (classical) music. The text's introductory verses on dance also show similarities to those found in the **Abhinayadarpana** (Mirror of Gesture) ascribed to Nandikeśvara.

### Authoritative Sources
The study and understanding of the *Saṃgītaratnākara* rely heavily on a tradition of scholarly commentaries and modern translations:

*   **Commentaries:** The most famous and authoritative commentary is **Kallinātha's *Kalanidhi*** (c. 15th century), which is essential for interpreting the technical and complex aspects of the text. Another important early commentary is **Siṃhabhūpāla's *Sudhākara*** (c. 14th century).
*   **Modern Editions and Translations:** Key scholarly resources include the multi-volume translation by **R.K. Shringy and Prem Lata Sharma**, titled *Saṃgītaratnākara of Śārṅgadeva*, and the translation by **C. Kunhan Raja** in the Adyar Library Series, *The Sangitaratnakara of Sarngadeva*.
*   **Scholarly Works:** The text is a central focus in the works of eminent musicologists such as **V. Raghavan**, **P. Sambamoorthy**, and **Emmie te Nijenhuis**.

## **Vāstu Śāstra** (वास्तु शास्त्र) - Ancient Indian architecture and design

**Author/Tradition**: *Vāstu Śāstra* is not a single text but a collection of traditional Hindu architectural and design principles codified in various Sanskrit manuals known as *Vāstu-Śāstras*. The knowledge system is part of *Vastu Vidya* (knowledge of dwelling).
*   **Traditional Authorship:** The principles are traditionally attributed to the divine architect **Vishwakarma** (the architect of the gods) and the sage **Maya** (as in the *Mayamata* text).
*   **Key Texts:** The most studied and authoritative surviving texts include the *Mayamata*, *Mānasāra*, *Samarāṅgaṇa Sūtradhāra*, *Rājavallabha*, *Viśvakarmaprakāśa*, and *Aparājitapṛcchā*.

**Historical Period**: *Vāstu Śāstra* is an ancient tradition with a long developmental history:
*   **Vedic Period (c. 1500 – 500 BCE):** The conceptual roots, including the worship of *Vāstoṣpati* and the ritual geometry of the *yajña* altar, are found in the Vedas.
*   **Classical Period (c. 6th Century CE onwards):** The principles were systematically codified into the extant *Vāstu Śāstra* texts. **Varāhamihira's *Bṛhat Saṃhitā*** (c. 6th century CE) is one of the earliest known texts to dedicate chapters to architecture and town planning.
*   **Medieval Period (c. 7th – 13th Century CE):** This period saw the composition of major texts like the ***Mayamata*** (c. 7th-9th century CE) and the ***Mānasāra*** (c. 11th-13th century CE), which became the definitive manuals for temple and residential architecture, particularly in South India.
*   **Historical Context:** The principles were instrumental in the design and construction of major Hindu temples (like Angkor Wat) and planned cities throughout ancient and medieval India.

### Core Teachings
The core teaching of *Vāstu Śāstra* is the creation of harmonious living and working environments by aligning the built space with the natural and cosmic forces. This harmony is achieved through the proper application of the **Vāstu Puruṣa Maṇḍala** and the balancing of the **Pañca Mahābhūtas** (five great elements).
*   **Cosmic Alignment:** The design seeks to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns, symmetry, and directional alignments.
*   **Energy Flow:** The principles guide the flow of *prāṇa* (life-force energy) within a structure, ensuring that positive energy enters and circulates, leading to health, prosperity, and peace for the occupants.
*   **Directional Significance:** Specific directions are assigned to different activities and rooms (e.g., North-East for water/prayer, South-East for fire/kitchen), based on the flow of solar and magnetic energies.

### Key Concepts
| Sanskrit Term (IAST) | Devanagari | Meaning and Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vāstu Puruṣa Maṇḍala** | वास्तु पुरुष मण्डल | The metaphysical plan or grid used in Vāstu Śāstra. It is a square diagram representing the cosmos and the body of the Vāstu Puruṣa (Cosmic Man), who is the deity of the site. It dictates the placement of functions within a building. |
| **Pañca Mahābhūtas** | पञ्च महाभूत | The Five Great Elements: *Bhūmi* (Earth), *Jala* (Water), *Agni* (Fire), *Vāyu* (Air), and *Ākāśa* (Space). Vāstu aims to balance these elements in a structure, with each element corresponding to a specific direction. |
| **Diśā** | दिशा | Direction. The eight cardinal and inter-cardinal directions (e.g., North, North-East, South-East) are central to Vāstu, as they govern the flow of energy and determine the appropriate function of a space. |
| **Brāhmasthāna** | ब्रह्मस्थान | The central, unbuilt, and most sacred zone of the Maṇḍala. It is the nucleus of the house, representing the source of cosmic energy (Brahman) and must be kept open and clean. |
| **Prāṇa** | प्राण | Life-force energy. Vāstu principles are designed to maximize the positive flow of *prāṇa* into and through the dwelling. |

### Structure
*Vāstu Śāstra* is a body of literature, not a single text, but the individual *Vāstu-Śāstras* (like the *Mayamata* or *Mānasāra*) are typically structured as comprehensive manuals.
*   **Sections:** The texts are generally divided into chapters (*adhyāyas*) that cover a logical progression of architectural topics.
*   **Typical Content Flow:**
    1.  **Foundational Concepts:** Invocation, definition of *Vāstu* and *Vāstu Puruṣa*, and the significance of the *Maṇḍala*.
    2.  **Site Selection and Preparation:** Examination of soil, terrain, and auspicious times for construction.
    3.  **Measurement and Geometry (*Māna*):** Detailed rules for proportions, units of measurement, and geometric layouts.
    4.  **Residential Architecture (*Gṛha Vāstu*):** Design of houses, including the placement of rooms, doors, and windows based on direction.
    5.  **Temple Architecture (*Prāsāda Vāstu*):** Detailed instructions for the design, construction, and iconography of temples.
    6.  **Town and City Planning (*Nagara Vāstu*):** Layout of villages, towns, roads, water bodies, and public spaces.
*   **Format:** The texts are composed in Sanskrit verses (*ślokas*), often in various meters, and presented as a dialogue between a sage (like Maya or Viśvakarmā) and a disciple.

### Practical Applications
*Vāstu Śāstra* is widely applied today in India and globally, moving beyond its traditional use for temples and palaces to modern residential and commercial architecture.
*   **Residential Design:** It is used to determine the optimal placement of rooms (kitchen, bedroom, living area), doors, windows, and furniture to ensure the flow of positive energy, health, and prosperity. For example, the main entrance is often preferred in the North, East, or North-East.
*   **Commercial and Urban Planning:** Principles are applied to the layout of offices, factories, and even entire town plans to promote business success and community well-being. The central *Brāhmasthāna* is often maintained as an open courtyard or atrium.
*   **Modern Adaptations:** Contemporary architects and designers integrate Vāstu principles with modern building codes and sustainable architecture, focusing on natural light, ventilation, and energy efficiency, which align with the original intent of harmonizing with nature.
*   **Pseudoscience vs. Scholarly Practice:** While some commercial practitioners market it as a quick-fix superstition, scholarly application focuses on its value as a traditional architectural theory rooted in geometry, climate, and directional science.

### Key Verses/Passages
While *Vāstu Śāstra* is a vast collection of texts, a foundational concept is the invocation of the Vāstu Puruṣa. A key verse from the *Matsya Purāṇa* describes the origin of the Vāstu Puruṣa and the significance of the Maṇḍala.

**Verse (Concept of Vāstu Puruṣa):**

| Sanskrit (Devanagari) | IAST Transliteration | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **वास्तु पुरुषं पूजयित्वा ततः कर्म समारभेत्।** | *Vāstu puruṣaṃ pūjayitvā tataḥ karma samārabhet.* | "Having worshipped the Vāstu Puruṣa, one should then commence the work (of construction)." |
| **यस्मिन् देशे यदाकारं गृहं तत्र प्रकीर्तितम्।** | *Yasmin deśe yadākāraṃ gṛhaṃ tatra prakīrtitam.* | "In whatever region, whatever form of house is proclaimed, (that should be followed)." |

**Excerpt from *Mayamata* (Definition of Vāstu):**

The *Mayamata* defines *Vāstu* and *Vāstu-vidyā* in its opening verses:

> **"Vāstu is that which is the dwelling place of both immortals and mortals. Vāstu-vidyā is the knowledge concerning this Vāstu."**

This highlights the dual purpose of the science: to serve both the spiritual and material needs of life. The texts are filled with technical verses detailing measurements (*māna*), orientation (*diśā*), and material properties.

### Cross-References
The principles of *Vāstu Śāstra* are deeply rooted in the broader Hindu textual tradition:
*   **Vedas:** The origins are often traced to the **Sthāpatyaveda**, an *Upaveda* (applied science) of the **Atharvaveda**, which deals with architecture and construction. References to the concept of *Vāstu* and the deity *Vāstoṣpati* (protector of the dwelling) are found in the **Ṛgveda** and **Atharvaveda**.
*   **Purāṇas:** The **Matsya Purāṇa** contains a detailed section on *Vāstu Śāstra*, including the legend of the *Vāstu Puruṣa* and the construction of the *Maṇḍala*. The **Skanda Purāṇa** and **Agni Purāṇa** also contain chapters on architecture and town planning.
*   **Sūtras:** The mathematical and geometric foundations for construction, such as the rules for creating square altars (*yajña*), are found in the **Śulba Sūtras** (c. 4th century BCE).
*   **Other Śāstras:** The *Vāstu Śāstras* are closely related to **Śilpa Śāstras** (manuals on sculpture and iconography) and texts like **Kautilya's Arthaśāstra** (c. 2nd century BCE - 3rd century CE), which dedicates chapters to domestic architecture, forts, and town planning.
