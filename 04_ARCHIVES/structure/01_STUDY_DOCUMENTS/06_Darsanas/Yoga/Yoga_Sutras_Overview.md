## Introduction

The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali is a foundational text of classical Yoga philosophy, consisting of 195 or 196 Sanskrit aphorisms (sūtras). Compiled by the sage Patañjali around 400 CE, the text is a systematic guide to the theory and practice of Yoga, drawing from older traditions and the dualistic metaphysics of the Sāṅkhya school. The Yoga Sūtras are the definitive text for Rāja Yoga (Classical Yoga) and provide a structured, eight-limbed path (Aṣṭāṅga Yoga) to spiritual liberation (kaivalya).

## Core Philosophy

The core philosophy of the Yoga Sūtras is encapsulated in the second sutra: **"yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ"** (Yoga is the restriction of the fluctuations of the mind). The ultimate goal is to achieve **kaivalya** (isolation or liberation), which is the realization of **Puruṣa** (pure consciousness) as distinct from **Prakṛti** (nature or matter). This is achieved through discriminative discernment (*viveka-khyāti*) cultivated through systematic practice (*abhyāsa*) and non-attachment (*vairāgya*).

## Structure

The Yoga Sūtras are divided into four chapters (pādas):

| Chapter (Pāda) | Title (English) | Sūtras | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Samādhi Pāda | 51 | Describes the goal of Yoga (samādhi), the nature of the mind's fluctuations (vṛttis), and the means to still them. |
| 2 | Sādhana Pāda | 55 | Outlines the practical path of Kriyā Yoga and the first five limbs of Aṣṭāṅga Yoga. |
| 3 | Vibhūti Pāda | 56 | Describes the last three limbs of Aṣṭāṅga Yoga (samyama) and the extraordinary powers (siddhis) that can arise. |
| 4 | Kaivalya Pāda | 34 | Describes the nature of liberation (kaivalya) and the ultimate reality of the Seer (Puruṣa). |

## The Eight Limbs of Yoga (Aṣṭāṅga Yoga)

The practical path to liberation is outlined in the eight limbs of yoga, described in the Sādhana and Vibhūti Pādas:

1.  **Yama** (Ethical Restraints): Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-possessiveness.
2.  **Niyama** (Ethical Observances): Purity, contentment, austerity, self-study, and surrender to a higher power.
3.  **Āsana** (Postures): Steady and comfortable physical postures.
4.  **Prāṇāyāma** (Breath Control): Regulation of the vital life force (prāṇa).
5.  **Pratyāhāra** (Withdrawal of the Senses): Turning the senses inward, away from external objects.
6.  **Dhāraṇā** (Concentration): Fixing the mind on a single point.
7.  **Dhyāna** (Meditation): Sustained, unbroken flow of attention to the object of concentration.
8.  **Samādhi** (Absorption): Complete absorption in the object of meditation, where the self is transcended.
