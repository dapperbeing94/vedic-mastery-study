# Mīmāṃsā Darśana - The School of Vedic Exegesis and Ritual

## Overview

**Mīmāṃsā** (मीमांसा, "investigation" or "inquiry"), also known as **Pūrva Mīmāṃsā** (Prior Investigation) or **Karma Mīmāṃsā** (Investigation of Action), is one of the six orthodox (āstika) schools of Hindu philosophy. Founded by the sage **Jaimini**, Mīmāṃsā is primarily concerned with the interpretation of Vedic texts, the justification of Vedic rituals, and the establishment of dharma (righteous duty) as the foundation of spiritual life.

---

## Historical Context

**Founder**: Jaimini (c. 3rd-1st century BCE), author of the Mīmāṃsā Sūtras

**Key Proponents**:
- **Śabara** (c. 1st-5th century CE) - Author of Śābara Bhāṣya
- **Kumārila Bhaṭṭa** (c. 7th century CE) - Founder of Bhaṭṭa sub-school
- **Prabhākara** (c. 7th century CE) - Founder of Prābhākara sub-school
- **Maṇḍana Miśra** (8th century CE) - Synthesizer of Mīmāṃsā and Advaita
- **Pārthasārathi Miśra** (14th century CE) - Author of Śāstradīpikā

**Historical Development**: Mīmāṃsā emerged from the Brāhmaṇa texts' concern with ritual interpretation. It developed sophisticated hermeneutical principles for Vedic exegesis and became the authoritative school for understanding dharma and ritual practice.

---

## Core Philosophy

Mīmāṃsā is fundamentally concerned with **dharma** (righteous duty) as revealed in the Vedas. Its central aim is to establish the authority of the Vedas, interpret Vedic injunctions correctly, and justify the performance of Vedic rituals as the means to both worldly prosperity and ultimate liberation.

### The Primacy of Dharma

- **Dharma** is known only through Vedic injunctions (vidhi)
- Dharma cannot be known through perception or inference
- The Vedas are the sole authoritative source (pramāṇa) for dharma
- Ritual action (karma) is the primary means of spiritual progress

## Epistemology: The Six Pramāṇas

Mīmāṃsā recognizes **six valid means of knowledge** (the most comprehensive list among orthodox schools):

### 1. Pratyakṣa (Perception)
Direct sensory experience through the five senses.

### 2. Anumāna (Inference)
Logical reasoning from known to unknown.

### 3. Upamāna (Comparison/Analogy)
Knowledge derived from similarity.

### 4. Arthāpatti (Postulation/Presumption)
Knowledge derived from necessary implication to explain an apparent contradiction.
- Example: "Devadatta is fat but does not eat during the day" → He must eat at night

### 5. Anupalabdhi (Non-apprehension/Absence)
Knowledge of non-existence through non-perception.
- Example: Absence of a pot on the table is known by not perceiving it

### 6. Śabda (Verbal Testimony)
Knowledge from authoritative verbal sources, especially the Vedas.

---

## Theory of Śabda (Verbal Authority)

Mīmāṃsā's most distinctive contribution is its elaborate theory of language and Vedic authority:

### The Eternality of the Vedas (Veda-Nityatva)

- The Vedas are **eternal** (nitya) and **authorless** (apauruṣeya)
- Words and their meanings have an eternal relationship
- The Vedas were not composed by any person, including God
- Each Vedic recitation manifests the eternal sound (śabda)

### The Authority of the Vedas (Veda-Prāmāṇya)

The Vedas are self-valid (svatah-prāmāṇya) because:
1. They are not composed by any person (hence free from human error)
2. There is no defect in the means of knowledge
3. All knowledge is intrinsically valid unless proven otherwise

### Hermeneutical Principles

Mīmāṃsā developed sophisticated rules for interpreting Vedic texts:

1. **Vidhi** (Injunction) - Commands to perform actions
2. **Niṣedha** (Prohibition) - Commands to avoid actions
3. **Mantra** (Sacred formula) - Verses used in rituals
4. **Nāmadheyā** (Names) - Designations of ritual elements
5. **Arthavāda** (Explanatory passage) - Praise, blame, or explanation
6. **Codanā** (Injunctive force) - The motivating power of Vedic commands

---

## Metaphysics

### Realistic Pluralism

Mīmāṃsā adopts a **realistic** and **pluralistic** metaphysics:

- The external world is real and independent of consciousness
- Multiple eternal substances exist (souls, atoms, etc.)
- No single creator God (early Mīmāṃsā was atheistic or non-theistic)

### The Self (Ātman)

- Multiple eternal individual selves exist
- The self is the agent of action and experiencer of results
- The self is distinct from body, mind, and senses
- The self is eternal, all-pervading, and conscious

### Theory of Karma

Mīmāṃsā developed the most elaborate theory of karma:

- **Apūrva** - The unseen potency created by ritual action
- Apūrva bridges the gap between action and its future result
- Karma operates through natural law, not divine intervention
- Proper performance of rituals creates merit (puṇya)

### Early Atheism

Early Mīmāṃsā was **atheistic** or **non-theistic**:
- No need for God to explain the universe or karma
- The Vedas are eternal and authorless
- Dharma operates through impersonal cosmic law

Later Mīmāṃsā (especially Kumārila) incorporated God as the arranger of the cosmic order.

## The Two Sub-Schools

### 1. Bhāṭṭa School (Kumārila Bhaṭṭa)

**Key Doctrines**:
- **Abhihitānvaya** - Words first denote individual meanings, then sentence meaning is derived
- Accepts God as the arranger of atoms and karma
- Liberation (mokṣa) is the permanent cessation of suffering
- Emphasizes the importance of knowledge along with ritual

### 2. Prābhākara School (Prabhākara)

**Key Doctrines**:
- **Anvitābhidhāna** - Words directly denote relational meanings within sentences
- More orthodox emphasis on ritual over knowledge
- Liberation is the continuous performance of duty without desire for results
- Theory of **triputī** - Every cognition involves three factors: subject, object, and cognition itself

---

## Liberation (Mokṣa)

Mīmāṃsā's view of liberation evolved:

### Early View (Ritual-Centered)
- Heaven (svarga) as the ultimate goal
- Achieved through proper performance of Vedic rituals
- No concept of final liberation from rebirth

### Later View (Kumārila)
- **Mokṣa** as the permanent cessation of suffering and rebirth
- Achieved through both ritual (karma) and knowledge (jñāna)
- Liberation is a state of pure existence without experience

### Prābhākara View
- Liberation is the continuous performance of dharma without attachment
- Emphasis on **niṣkāma karma** (desireless action)
- Influenced the Bhagavad Gītā's karma yoga

---

## Key Texts

1. **Mīmāṃsā Sūtras** (Jaimini) - Foundational text with 12 chapters
2. **Śābara Bhāṣya** (Śabara) - First major commentary
3. **Ślokavārttika** (Kumārila) - Verse commentary on Śābara Bhāṣya
4. **Tantravārttika** (Kumārila) - Prose commentary
5. **Bṛhatī** (Prabhākara) - Commentary establishing Prābhākara school
6. **Śāstradīpikā** (Pārthasārathi Miśra) - Later systematic exposition

## Relationship to Other Darśanas

### Complement to Vedānta

- **Mīmāṃsā** (Pūrva Mīmāṃsā) - Interprets the karma-kāṇḍa (ritual portion) of the Vedas
- **Vedānta** (Uttara Mīmāṃsā) - Interprets the jñāna-kāṇḍa (knowledge portion) of the Vedas
- Together they provide a complete Vedic worldview

### Debates with Buddhism

Mīmāṃsā vigorously defended:
- The authority of the Vedas against Buddhist rejection
- The reality of the external world against Buddhist idealism
- The permanence of the self against Buddhist no-self doctrine

### Influence on Vedānta

- Mīmāṃsā hermeneutical principles were adopted by Vedānta for interpreting Upanishads
- Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, and Madhva all used Mīmāṃsā exegetical methods
- The concept of svatah-prāmāṇya (self-validity) influenced Vedānta epistemology

---

## Historical Influence

**Hermeneutics**: Mīmāṃsā developed the most sophisticated system of textual interpretation in Indian philosophy, influencing all subsequent schools.

**Philosophy of Language**: Its theories of word-meaning relationships, sentence meaning, and linguistic authority are studied in modern philosophy of language.

**Legal Theory**: Mīmāṃsā principles influenced Hindu legal interpretation and dharmaśāstra literature.

**Ritual Studies**: Provided the theoretical foundation for understanding Vedic and Hindu ritual practice.
