## Introduction

The Brahma Sūtras, also known as the Vedānta Sūtras, are a foundational text of the Vedānta school of Hindu philosophy. Attributed to the sage Bādarāyaṇa, who is traditionally identified with Vyāsa, the Brahma Sūtras systematically summarize and harmonize the philosophical teachings of the Upaniṣads. The text consists of 555 aphoristic verses (sūtras) that are famously concise and require a commentary (bhāṣya) for their full meaning to be understood. The Brahma Sūtras form the *Nyāya Prasthāna* (logical starting point) of the *Prasthānatrayī*, the three canonical texts of Vedānta, alongside the Upaniṣads (*Śruti Prasthāna*) and the Bhagavad Gītā (*Smṛti Prasthāna*).

## Core Philosophy

The central philosophy of the Brahma Sūtras is the establishment of Brahman as the ultimate reality and the sole cause of the universe's origin, sustenance, and dissolution. The text argues that Brahman can only be known through the authority of the scriptures (*śāstra*) and not through mere perception or logic. The first four sutras, known as the *Chatuḥsūtrī*, lay out the entire framework of Vedānta:

1.  **Athāto Brahma Jijñāsā**: Now, therefore, the inquiry into Brahman.
2.  **Janmādyasya Yataḥ**: (Brahman is that) from which the origin, sustenance, and dissolution of the world (proceed).
3.  **Śāstra-Yonitvāt**: (Brahman is known) because it is the source of the scriptures.
4.  **Tat Tu Samanvayāt**: That (Brahman) is to be known from the scriptures because it is consistently taught therein.

## Structure

The Brahma Sūtras are organized into four chapters (*adhyāyas*), each with four quarters (*pādas*). This structure provides a systematic progression from establishing Brahman as the central theme of the Upanishads to describing the ultimate fruit of realizing Brahman.

| Chapter (Adhyāya) | Title (English) | Pādas | Total Sūtras | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Samanvaya (Harmony) | 4 | 134 | Establishes that all Upanishadic texts are in harmony and point to Brahman. |
| 2 | Avirodha (Non-Contradiction) | 4 | 157 | Refutes rival philosophical systems and resolves internal contradictions. |
| 3 | Sādhana (Means) | 4 | 186 | Discusses the means to attain the knowledge of Brahman, including spiritual disciplines. |
| 4 | Phala (Fruit) | 4 | 78 | Describes the result of realizing Brahman, including liberation (mokṣa). |

## Commentarial Traditions

The extreme brevity of the Brahma Sūtras has given rise to numerous commentaries, each establishing a distinct school of Vedānta. The three most influential commentaries are:

-   **Adi Shankaracharya (Advaita Vedānta)**: Shankara's commentary establishes the non-dualistic philosophy of Advaita, asserting the absolute identity of the individual soul (Ātman) and Brahman. The world is considered *mithyā* (illusory).
-   **Ramanujacharya (Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta)**: Ramanuja's *Śrī Bhāṣya* establishes qualified non-dualism, where the individual soul and the world are real attributes of a personal God (Viṣṇu).
-   **Madhvacharya (Dvaita Vedānta)**: Madhva's commentary establishes a dualistic philosophy, asserting an eternal distinction between God, the individual soul, and the world.
