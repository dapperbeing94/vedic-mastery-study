## 💭 Commentary Summary

**Shankara's Commentary (Advaita Vedanta):**
Shankara interprets the verse as a denunciation of exclusive worship of either the unmanifest cause or the manifest effect, advocating for the combination of both (*samuccaya*) for liberation.
*   **Asambhūti (Unmanifest):** Interpreted as **Avyakrita Prakriti** (unmanifest nature), which is the material cause of the universe, ignorance (*avidyā*), and the seed of all desire and *karma*. Exclusive devotion to this leads to "blind darkness" (*andhaṃ tamaḥ*), which is a state of mere blindness or ignorance.
*   **Sambhūti (Manifest):** Interpreted as **Karya Brahman Hiranyagarbha** (the Cosmic Mind or the first manifest being). Exclusive devotion to this leads to "even greater darkness" (*bhūya iva tamaḥ*).
The verse thus warns against mistaking either the unmanifest cause or the manifest effect for the ultimate reality (Brahman) and emphasizes the need to transcend both through the combination of knowledge and action (or worship).

**Madhva's Commentary (Dvaita Vedanta):**
Madhva interprets *Asambhūti* as the Destroyer aspect of the Lord and *Sambhūti* as the Creator aspect. The verse warns that those who worship the Lord only as the Destroyer enter gloomy darkness, but those who worship Him only as the Creator enter even greater darkness. This emphasizes the need to worship the Lord in His complete form, encompassing both creation and destruction.
