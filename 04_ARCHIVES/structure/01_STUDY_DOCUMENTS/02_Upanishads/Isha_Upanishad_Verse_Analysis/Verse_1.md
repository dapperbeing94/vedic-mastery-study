## 💭 Commentary Summary

The first verse is primarily addressed to those on the **Path of Knowledge (Jnana-nishtha)** and **renunciation (Nivritti marga)**, according to **Adi Shankaracharya** [1].

**Shankara's Commentary:**
The core message is that the entire universe, both movable and immovable, is pervaded or "covered" by *Īśa* (the Lord, the *Paramātman*). Since the world is considered **unreal in absolute truth** (*mithyā*), one should contemplate the *Ātman* as the inner self of all, with the idea, "I alone am all this." This contemplation leads to **complete renunciation** (*tyāga*) of all desires, including the three-fold desire for son, wealth, and fame (*putreṣaṇā, vitteṣaṇā, lokeṣaṇā*). The phrase *tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā* is interpreted as: "By such renunciation, protect (the Self)." The final command, *mā gṛdhaḥ kasya sviddhanam*, is a prohibition against coveting any wealth, either one's own or another's, because all belongs to the *Ātman*. An alternative interpretation of the last line is a rhetorical question: "Do not covet, for whose is wealth?"—implying that no one truly owns anything [1].

**Other Commentaries (Swami Sivananda):**
Swami Sivananda reinforces Shankara's view, emphasizing that the world is superimposed on the *Ātman* due to **nescience (*Avidyā*)**. He stresses the need for **total renunciation**, which includes renouncing the desire for liberation and even the pride of renunciation itself (*Tyāga Abhimāna*), to realize the ultimate truth: "The knower of Brahman becomes Brahman" (*Brahmavit Brahmaiva Bhavati*) [1].
