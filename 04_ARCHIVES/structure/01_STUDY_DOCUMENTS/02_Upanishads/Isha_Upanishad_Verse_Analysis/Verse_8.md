## 💭 Commentary Summary

This verse describes the true nature of the Self (Atman/Brahman) for the purpose of meditation (Upāsanā). Shankara's commentary emphasizes the Self's freedom from all limitations and dualities. The Self is described by a series of negative attributes (e.g., **akāyam** - bodiless, **avraṇam** - scatheless, **apāpaviddham** - untouched by sin) to distinguish it from the conditioned self (Jīva) and the physical world. It is also described by positive attributes (e.g., **kaviḥ** - Seer, **manīṣī** - all-knowing, **svayambhūḥ** - self-existent). The final part, where the Self "has duly allotted to the eternal World-Creators their respective duties," is interpreted by Shankara as the Self, as the all-knowing Lord (Ishvara), impartially distributing the fruits of deeds (**arthān**) to all beings according to the facts (**yāthātathyataḥ**) of their Karma. This highlights the Self's role as the supreme, non-attached dispenser of the cosmic law.
