## 💭 Commentary Summary

The final verse of the Isha Upanishad is a prayer to **Agni** (Fire, symbolizing the divine will or knowledge) for guidance and purification. Shankara's commentary emphasizes that this prayer is made by a seeker who has performed all the prescribed duties (Karma) and is now on the verge of attaining the highest knowledge (Jnana). The prayer for the "good path" (**Supathā**) is interpreted by Shankara as a request to avoid the "southern route" (Dakṣiṇāyana), which leads to the world of the ancestors and eventual return to the cycle of birth and death (Samsara). Instead, the seeker prays for the "northern route" (Uttarāyaṇa), the path of the gods, which leads to liberation (Moksha) and non-return. The verse also includes a plea to remove the "sin of deceit" (**Juhurāṇamenaḥ**), which Shankara interprets as the removal of all obstacles, sins, and the deceitful tendencies of the mind that prevent the attainment of true knowledge. The final act of offering "many prostrations" signifies the complete surrender of the ego and the culmination of all ritualistic actions in devotion and knowledge [1] [2]. The verse is thus seen as the final aspiration of the seeker who has lived a life of action and knowledge, now seeking the final grace for liberation.
