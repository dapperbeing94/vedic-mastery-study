## 💭 Commentary Summary

The third verse is introduced by Shankara to condemn those who lack the knowledge of the **Atman** (Self). He interprets **ātma-hanaḥ** as "slayers of the Atman," which he clarifies are those who do not know the Self. They "kill" the eternal Atman by drawing the veil of **ignorance** (**avidyā**) over it, thereby obscuring its true, immortal nature. This fault of "slaying the Atman" leads them into the cycle of *Samsara* (repeated birth and death) [1] [2]. Swami Sivananda echoes this, stating that *ātma-hanaḥ* are those who are self-deluded, mistaking the perishable body for the imperishable Self, and whose minds are filled with passion, greed, and egoism. Their failure to realize the Self leads them to worlds of darkness [2]. The verse essentially warns that the only "hell" is the absence of knowledge, and those overpowered by the darkness of ignorance remain slaves to the cycle of suffering [4].
