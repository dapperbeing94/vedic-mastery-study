## 💭 Commentary Summary

The verse is interpreted by **Shankara** as pointing out the distinct results of worshipping the **Manifest** (*Sambhūti* or *Kārya Brahman*/Hiranyagarbha) and the **Unmanifest** (*Asambhūti* or *Prakriti*). This distinction is made to advocate for the **combination** (*Samuccaya*) of the two forms of worship (or knowledge) as the means to liberation. Worship of the Manifest leads to the attainment of supernatural powers (*Aṇimā* and other *Siddhis*), while worship of the Unmanifest leads to temporary absorption (*Laya*) into the causal state (*Prakriti*). Both results are considered limited and non-liberating, thus necessitating the synthesis of both paths [1] [2]. Other commentaries emphasize that the verse is a statement from the wise (*dhīrāṇām*) who have experienced the different outcomes of these two paths, thereby validating the need for a holistic approach [3].
