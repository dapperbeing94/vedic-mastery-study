## 💭 Commentary Summary

The verse is interpreted by **Adi Shankaracharya** as a denunciation of the exclusive pursuit of either ritualistic action (**Avidya**) or meditation on a deity (**Vidya**), in order to praise the necessity of their combination. According to Shankara, *Avidya* refers to **Karma** (Vedic rites like Agnihotra) performed with a desire for results, and *Vidya* refers to **Upasana** (meditation on the lower deities). He argues that pursuing only Karma leads to the darkness of *Pitriloka* (the world of the ancestors), while pursuing only Upasana leads to an even greater darkness, as both are ultimately temporary and lead back to the cycle of *Samsara*. The verse thus serves as an introduction to the next two verses (10 and 11), which explicitly advocate for the simultaneous practice of both. **Swami Sivananda** echoes this view, defining *Avidya* as Karmas performed with expectation of fruits and *Vidya* as inferior knowledge (knowledge of deities), and recommending their combination.
