## 💭 Commentary Summary

**Shankara's Commentary (Advaita Vedanta):** Shankara interprets the verse as continuing the theme of the previous verse, describing the paradoxical nature of the **Atman** (Self) or **Brahman**. He explains that the Atman is intrinsically **motionless** (naijati), but *appears* to move (ejati) due to its association with the limiting adjuncts (Upadhis) of the phenomenal world. It is **distant** (dūre) for the ignorant who cannot attain it even over vast periods, but it is **very near** (antike) to the knowing (those who realize it as their own Self). It is both **within all** (antarasya sarvasya) and **without all** (sarvasyāsya bāhyataḥ), being all-pervading like the Akasha (ether) and yet the subtle, indivisible essence of knowledge.

**Swami Sivananda's Commentary:** Sivananda echoes the paradoxical nature, stating that the Atman is the **primum-mobile** (prime mover) that causes Prakriti (Nature) to move by its mere presence, hence "It moves." However, since it is all-pervading and all-full, it is also "motionless." It is distant for the selfish and ignorant, but very near for the sincere seeker who possesses purity of mind and practices Sravana, Manana, and Nididhyasana (hearing, reflection, and meditation), as it is their **Inner Self (Antar-Atman)**. It is the subtle substratum (Adhishthana) of all beings.
