The **Gheranda Samhita** is a comprehensive Sanskrit text on Hatha Yoga, presented as a dialogue between the sage Gheranda and his disciple, King Chanda Kapali. It is considered one of the three foundational texts of classical Hatha Yoga, along with the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Shiva Samhita.

## 2. Author and Lineage

- **Author**: Attributed to the sage Gheranda.
- **Date**: Late 17th century CE.
- **Lineage**: The text does not explicitly trace a lineage but focuses on the practical instruction of Ghatastha Yoga.

## 3. Structure

The Gheranda Samhita is organized into seven chapters (Upadeśas) with approximately 351 verses, corresponding to the seven limbs of Ghatastha Yoga:

| Chapter | Title | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shatkarma | Purification |
| 2 | Asana | Strengthening |
| 3 | Mudra | Steadiness |
| 4 | Pratyahara | Calmness |
| 5 | Pranayama | Lightness |
| 6 | Dhyana | Perception |
| 7 | Samadhi | Isolation/Liberation |

## 4. Core Teachings

The central teaching of the Gheranda Samhita is **Ghatastha Yoga**, the "yoga of the body-pot." The body is viewed as a vessel that must be purified and strengthened through yogic practices to achieve liberation (moksha). The text outlines a unique sevenfold path (Saptanga Yoga) that emphasizes the physical and physiological aspects of yoga as the foundation for spiritual attainment.

## 5. Key Practices

- **Shatkarmas**: Six cleansing actions for purifying the body.
- **Asanas**: The text describes 32 asanas for strengthening the body.
- **Mudras**: 25 psycho-physical gestures for sealing the prana.
- **Pranayama**: 10 types of breath retention for controlling the prana.
- **Dhyana**: Three types of meditation for developing concentration.

## 6. Significance

The Gheranda Samhita is significant for its encyclopedic and systematic presentation of Hatha Yoga practices. It provides a detailed and practical manual for practitioners and has been an invaluable resource for understanding the full breadth of pre-modern Hatha Yoga.

## 7. Relationship to Other Texts

The Gheranda Samhita is often compared to the **Hatha Yoga Pradipika**. While both texts cover similar practices, the Gheranda Samhita is more encyclopedic in its coverage of physical techniques and presents a unique sevenfold path to liberation.
