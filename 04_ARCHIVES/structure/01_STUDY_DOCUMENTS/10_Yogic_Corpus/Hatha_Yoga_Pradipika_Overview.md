The **Hatha Yoga Pradipika** (HP) is a classical Sanskrit manual on Hatha Yoga, written by **Svātmārāma** in the 15th century CE. It is one of the most influential texts of Hatha Yoga and is considered a foundational work for modern yoga practices. The text synthesizes earlier Hatha Yoga teachings and presents them in a systematic and accessible format.

## 4. Core Teachings

The central teaching of the HP is that **Hatha Yoga is a preparatory step for Raja Yoga**. The text emphasizes the purification of the physical body and the control of vital energies (prana) as a means to achieve the ultimate goal of Samadhi. The term "Hatha" is often interpreted as the union of the sun (Ha) and the moon (Tha), representing the balance of the vital energies.
