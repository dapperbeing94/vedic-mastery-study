## Introduction

Chapter 2 is the philosophical heart of the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna begins his divine teachings to Arjuna. In response to Arjuna's despair, Krishna introduces the fundamental principles of Hindu philosophy, including the nature of the soul, the concept of dharma, and the path of selfless action (Karma Yoga).

## Key Teachings

1.  **The Eternal Soul**: Krishna explains that the soul (Atman) is eternal, unborn, and indestructible. It does not die when the body dies, just as a person discards old clothes for new ones. Therefore, Arjuna should not grieve for those who will be killed in battle.
2.  **The Nature of Duty (Dharma)**: Krishna reminds Arjuna of his duty as a warrior (Kshatriya). To fight for a righteous cause is the highest duty of a warrior, and to abandon it would bring infamy and sin.
3.  **The Path of Selfless Action (Karma Yoga)**: Krishna introduces the central teaching of the Gita: to perform one's duty without attachment to the fruits of action. One has a right to the action, but not to its results. This is the key to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
4.  **The Qualities of a Sage (Sthitaprajna)**: Arjuna asks about the qualities of a person of steady wisdom. Krishna describes the sthitaprajna as one who is free from desires, attachments, fear, and anger, and who has complete control over the senses.

## Key Themes

-   **Eternal Soul**: The distinction between the eternal, unchanging soul and the temporary, perishable body.
-   **Karma Yoga**: The path of selfless action as a means to liberation.
-   **Detachment**: The importance of performing one's duty without attachment to the results.
-   **Dharma**: The concept of righteous duty and its importance in life.

## Key Verse

> "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but not to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results, nor be attached to not doing your duty." (BG 2.47)

## Commentarial Perspectives

-   **Shankara (Advaita)**: Shankara emphasizes the teachings on the eternal nature of the soul and the unreality of the body. He sees this chapter as establishing the foundation for the path of knowledge (jnana yoga), which is the ultimate means to liberation.
-   **Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)**: Ramanuja focuses on the concept of Karma Yoga as a form of devotion to God. He interprets the teachings on the soul as a means to understand one's relationship with God and to perform one's duties as an offering to Him.
-   **Madhva (Dvaita)**: Madhva highlights the importance of performing one's duty as an act of obedience to God's will. He sees this chapter as a call to action, guided by faith and devotion to the Supreme Lord.
