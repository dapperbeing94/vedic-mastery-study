## Introduction

In Chapter 8, Arjuna asks Krishna about the meaning of several technical terms, including Brahman, adhyatma, karma, adhibhuta, and adhidaiva. Krishna answers these questions and then explains the importance of remembering him at the time of death, which is the key to attaining his supreme abode.

## Key Teachings

1.  **Definitions of Key Terms**: Krishna defines the key terms as follows:
    *   **Brahman**: The indestructible, transcendental living entity.
    *   **Adhyatma**: The eternal nature of the soul.
    *   **Karma**: Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities.
    *   **Adhibhuta**: The physical manifestation, which is constantly changing.
    *   **Adhidaiva**: The universal form of the Lord.
2.  **Remembering Krishna at Death**: Krishna emphasizes that whatever one remembers at the time of death, that state one will attain without fail. Therefore, one who remembers Krishna alone at the time of death attains his supreme abode.
3.  **The Practice of Remembrance**: To be able to remember Krishna at the time of death, one must constantly engage in devotional service and fix the mind on him throughout one's life.
4.  **The Abode of Krishna**: Krishna describes his supreme abode as the destination from which, having attained it, one never returns to the material world. This is the ultimate goal of all spiritual practice.
5.  **The Cosmic Cycles**: Krishna explains the cosmic cycles of creation and dissolution. He describes the day and night of Brahma, which last for thousands of ages, and explains how the living entities are manifested and unmanifested with the coming of day and night.

## Key Themes

-   **Ultimate Reality**: The nature of Brahman and the supreme abode of the Lord.
-   **Life After Death**: The journey of the soul after death and the importance of the final thought.
-   **Cosmic Cycles**: The vast cycles of creation and dissolution in the material world.
-   **Final Remembrance**: The practice of remembering God at the time of death as the key to liberation.

## Key Verse

> "And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt." (BG 8.5)

## Commentarial Perspectives

-   **Shankara (Advaita)**: Shankara interprets the chapter as a guide to the practice of meditation on the sacred syllable Om, which is a representation of Brahman. He sees this as a means to gradually purify the mind and prepare it for the ultimate realization of the non-dual self.
-   **Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)**: Ramanuja emphasizes the importance of remembering the personal form of the Lord at the time of death. He sees the chapter as a confirmation that devotion to God is the most effective means of attaining liberation.
-   **Madhva (Dvaita)**: Madhva highlights the supreme importance of devotion to Lord Vishnu as the only means of escaping the cycle of birth and death. He interprets the chapter as a call to surrender completely to the will of the Lord.
