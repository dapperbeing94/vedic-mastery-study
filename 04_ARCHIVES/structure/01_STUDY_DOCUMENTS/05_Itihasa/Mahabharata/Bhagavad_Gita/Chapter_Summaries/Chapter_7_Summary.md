_part1', text="# Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 7: Knowledge of the Absolute (Jnana Vijnana Yoga)

**Author**: Manus AI
**Date**: November 22, 2025

## Introduction

In Chapter 7, Krishna begins to reveal his divine nature more fully, explaining the distinction between his material and spiritual energies. He describes himself as the source of all creation and the ultimate reality behind all phenomena. This chapter marks the beginning of the second section of the Gita, which focuses on Bhakti Yoga, the path of devotion.

## Key Teachings

1.  **Two Natures of God**: Krishna explains that he has two natures: a lower, material nature (prakriti), which consists of the eight elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, and false ego), and a higher, spiritual nature (para prakriti), which consists of the living entities who are struggling with the material nature.
2.  **The Source of All Creation**: Krishna declares that he is the source of all that is material and spiritual in this world. Everything rests upon him, as pearls are strung on a thread.
3.  **The Divine and Demonic**: Krishna describes four kinds of pious men who render devotional service to him and four kinds of impious men who do not. The four kinds of pious men are the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and the one who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.
4.  **The Veil of Illusion (Maya)**: Krishna explains that he is not manifest to the foolish and unintelligent, who are covered by his internal potency (yoga-maya). Such persons do not know him as the unborn and infallible.

## Commentarial Perspectives

-   **Shankara (Advaita)**: Shankara interprets this chapter as a description of the two aspects of Brahman: the lower, qualified Brahman (Saguna Brahman), which is the cause of the universe, and the higher, unqualified Brahman (Nirguna Brahman), which is the ultimate reality. He maintains that devotion to Saguna Brahman is a step towards the realization of Nirguna Brahman.
-   **Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)**: Ramanuja sees this chapter as a revelation of God's supreme personality and his relationship with the world and the individual souls. He emphasizes that devotion to this personal God is the highest path to liberation.
-   **Madhva (Dvaita)**: Madhva interprets this chapter as a confirmation of God's absolute supremacy and the eternal dependence of the individual soul. He sees the different types of devotees as evidence of the hierarchical nature of souls.
