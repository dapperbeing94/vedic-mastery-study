## Introduction

In Chapter 6, Krishna provides detailed instructions on the practice of meditation (Dhyana Yoga) as a means of controlling the mind and senses and achieving self-realization. He describes the ideal conditions for meditation, the qualities of a true yogi, and the ultimate goal of this practice.

## Key Teachings

1.  **The Practice of Meditation**: Krishna gives practical instructions for meditation, including the selection of a secluded place, the preparation of the seat, and the posture of the body. He advises the yogi to hold the body, neck, and head erect and to fix the gaze at the tip of the nose.
2.  **The Control of the Mind**: The main challenge in meditation is the control of the restless and turbulent mind. Krishna advises the yogi to gradually withdraw the mind from sense objects and to fix it on the self. He compares the steady mind of a yogi to a lamp in a windless place that does not flicker.
3.  **The Goal of Meditation**: The ultimate goal of meditation is to attain a state of trance (samadhi), in which one experiences the supreme bliss of contact with Brahman. In this state, the yogi is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and is never shaken, even in the midst of the greatest difficulties.
4.  **The Fate of the Unsuccessful Yogi**: Arjuna asks about the fate of a yogi who begins the path with faith but is unable to achieve perfection due to an uncontrolled mind. Krishna assures him that a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with evil either in this world or the next. Such a person is reborn in a family of righteous people or wealthy aristocrats, where they can revive their spiritual consciousness and continue their practice.

## Commentarial Perspectives
