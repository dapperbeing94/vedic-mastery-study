# Vedic Mastery Study v2.0 - Tracking System Documentation

**Date**: November 22, 2025  
**Purpose**: Documentation for the Continuity and Thoroughness Protocol

---

## Overview

This document provides the complete documentation for the Vedic Mastery Study v2.0 tracking system. This system is designed to provide a persistent, objective, and automated way to track our progress across the entire Vedic framework.

---

## Core Components

1. **Database (`vedic_knowledge.db`)**: A SQLite database that stores all tracking data, including categories, subcategories, progress scores, and gap analysis.

2. **Architecture Document (`TRACKING_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`)**: Defines the scoring methodology, database schema, and overall design of the system.

3. **SQL Schema (`setup_tracking_schema.sql`)**: The SQL script to create all necessary tables and indexes in the database.

4. **Population Script (`populate_tracking.py`)**: A Python script that analyzes the study documents in the file system and populates the database with initial progress data.

5. **Tracking Script (`vedic_tracker.py`)**: The main Python script that provides the command-line interface for interacting with the tracking system.

## How to Use the Tracking System

### Command-Line Interface

The `vedic_tracker.py` script provides a simple command-line interface for managing the tracking system.

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/vedic-mastery-study
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py [COMMAND]
```

### Available Commands

#### 1. --dashboard

Generates a comprehensive dashboard showing the current state of the entire project.

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --dashboard
```

**Output**:
- Overall progress scores (breadth, depth, combined)
- Category-by-category breakdown
- Top 5 priorities based on gap analysis

#### 2. --recommend

Provides the top 5 recommended next steps to address the biggest gaps in our knowledge.

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --recommend
```

**Output**:
- A prioritized list of recommendations

#### 3. --update

Recalculates all breadth and depth scores based on the current state of the study documents.

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --update
```

#### 4. --status

Provides a quick overview of the overall progress scores.

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --status
```

## How It Works

### Scoring

- **Breadth (0-10)**: Measures the percentage of texts covered in a category.
- **Depth (0-10)**: Measures the quality of study for each text, based on file size, structure, and content.
- **Combined Score**: A weighted average of breadth (30%) and depth (70%).

### Gap Analysis

The system automatically identifies gaps by comparing our current scores to the target scores for each category. It then calculates a **priority score** for each gap based on:

- **Importance** of the category
- **Size** of the gap
- **Type** of gap (depth is prioritized over breadth)

### Recommendations

The recommendations are generated by ranking the gaps by their priority scores.

## Integration with Our Workflow

### At the Start of Each Session

1. Run `python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --dashboard` to get a complete picture of our current state.
2. Review the top 5 priorities to decide on our focus for the session.

### At the End of Each Session

1. Run `python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --update` to recalculate our progress.
2. Commit all changes to the GitHub repository, including the updated database.

## The Continuity and Thoroughness Protocol

This system ensures that:

- We have a **persistent, objective pulse** on our progress.
- We can **bounce between topics** without losing the end-to-end context.
- We always know **what to do next** to move closer to our goal.
