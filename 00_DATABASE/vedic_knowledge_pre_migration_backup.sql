The final part, where the Self "has duly allotted to the eternal World-Creators their respective duties," is interpreted by Shankara as the Self, as the all-knowing Lord (Ishvara), impartially distributing the fruits of deeds (**arthān**) to all beings according to the facts (**yāthātathyataḥ**) of their Karma. This highlights the Self''s role as the supreme, non-attached dispenser of the cosmic law.');

The prayer has two parts: 1) The dissolution of the physical body and the subtle body''s ascent. The phrase *vāyur anilam amṛtam* is a prayer for the *Prāṇa* (vital breath/subtle body) to merge into the all-pervading, immortal cosmic Air (*Sūtrātman*), which is a step towards liberation. The phrase *athedaṃ bhasmāntaṃ śarīram* is a recognition that the gross body will be reduced to ashes. 2) The repeated invocation *oṃ krato smara kṛtaṃ smara* is a prayer to the mind (*Kratu*, meaning will or resolve) to remember all the good deeds (*Kṛtam*) and spiritual practices performed throughout life. This remembrance is crucial for determining the soul''s trajectory after death, ensuring a favorable path (*Devayāna*) towards the realization of Brahman [1] [2]. **Other Commentaries (e.g., Swami Sivananda):** Swami Sivananda echoes the interpretation of the verse as a prayer of the dying man who has led a virtuous life. The remembrance of good deeds (*Kṛtam*) at the moment of death is seen as a means to attain bliss in the next world. He also notes that *Kratu* is sometimes interpreted as the sacrificial Fire (*Agni*) itself, or the mind, which is the seat of will and resolve [3]. **Sri Aurobindo''s Interpretation:** Sri Aurobindo, while acknowledging the traditional view, offers a more psychological interpretation. He sees the verse as a statement of fact and a psychological process: the vital breath (*Prāṇa*) is an immortal life, while the physical body is mortal. The prayer is a call to the *Will* (*Kratu*) to remember its past actions, suggesting a continuity of consciousness and a final act of will to align with the immortal life [4].');

Shankara''s commentary emphasizes that this prayer is made by a seeker who has performed all the prescribed duties (Karma) and is now on the verge of attaining the highest knowledge (Jnana). The prayer for the "good path" (**Supathā**) is interpreted by Shankara as a request to avoid the "southern route" (Dakṣiṇāyana), which leads to the world of the ancestors and eventual return to the cycle of birth and death (Samsara). Instead, the seeker prays for the "northern route" (Uttarāyaṇa), the path of the gods, which leads to liberation (Moksha) and non-return. The verse also includes a plea to remove the "sin of deceit" (**Juhurāṇamenaḥ**), which Shankara interprets as the removal of all obstacles, sins, and the deceitful tendencies of the mind that prevent the attainment of true knowledge. The final act of offering "many prostrations" signifies the complete surrender of the ego and the culmination of all ritualistic actions in devotion and knowledge [1] [2]. The verse is thus seen as the final aspiration of the seeker who has lived a life of action and knowledge, now seeking the final grace for liberation.');
