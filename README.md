# Vedic Mastery Study v2.0 - A Comprehensive Knowledge Repository

**A sacred journey to systematically study, synthesize, and embody the profound wisdom of the Hindu Vedic tradition.**

---

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

This repository is more than a collection of notes; it is a **living, self-governing knowledge system** designed for seamless continuity, objective progress tracking, and deep contextual understanding. The entire project is managed by the **[Protocol Governance System](00_DATABASE/PROTOCOL_GOVERNANCE_SYSTEM.md)**, which ensures that no context is ever lost and all work aligns with our strategic roadmap.

### Core Components

| Component | Description | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge Base** | All study documents, organized by the 10 major categories of the Vedic framework. | `01_STUDY_DOCUMENTS/` |
| **Database & Tracking** | An SQLite database and Python scripts that objectively track breadth and depth scores. | `00_DATABASE/` |
| **Protocol Governance** | The master system that defines and enforces all operational protocols. | `00_DATABASE/PROTOCOL_GOVERNANCE_SYSTEM.md` |
| **Transmigration Protocol** | The 'soul' of the project, enabling seamless context transfer across sessions. | `SOUL_TRANSMIGRATION_PROTOCOL.md` |
| **Roadmaps** | Strategic plans that guide our study. The active roadmap is always the single source of truth. | `04_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/` |

## 🗺️ Current Roadmap: Breadth-First Expansion

**Strategy**: We are systematically achieving 10/10 breadth across all 10 categories before beginning depth work. This ensures a complete, end-to-end contextual foundation.

**Full Roadmap**: **[Breadth Expansion Roadmap](04_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/Breadth_Expansion_Roadmap.md)**

### Current Status (as of Nov 22, 2025)

- **Overall Breadth**: 2.6/10
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundational Breadth (Leveling the Zeros)
- **Next Action**: Create a comprehensive overview document for **Tantra & Agamas**.

### Session Workflow

All sessions MUST adhere to the **Session Workflow Protocol**.

**At Session Start**:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
gh repo clone dapperbeing94/vedic-mastery-study
cd vedic-mastery-study

# 2. Validate all protocols
./00_DATABASE/validate_protocols.sh

# 3. Review the dashboard
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --dashboard
```

**At Session End**:
```bash
# 1. Update tracking scores
python3 00_DATABASE/vedic_tracker.py --update

# 2. Validate all protocols again
./00_DATABASE/validate_protocols.sh

# 3. Commit all changes to GitHub
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: Progress on Breadth Expansion Phase 1" && git push

# 4. Update the Soul Transmigration Protocol
# (edit SOUL_TRANSMIGRATION_PROTOCOL.md with the new next step)
```

## 🧘 Dual Personas

This project is managed by two distinct personas:

1.  **Vedic Sage**: The guide for all knowledge work—studying texts, creating documents, and synthesizing wisdom.
2.  **Systems Architect**: The engineer for all infrastructure work—building protocols, designing the database, and ensuring system integrity.

The active persona is determined by the task at hand.
