**Objective**: To ensure seamless context transfer and continuity between chat sessions for the Vedic Mastery Study project. This document serves as the "soul" of the project, containing all necessary information for a new agent instance to pick up exactly where the previous one left off.

**Instructions for Use**: To initiate a new session, provide the new agent with the following prompt:

"Please access and execute the Soul Transmigration Protocol located in the `SOUL_TRANSMIGRATION_PROTOCOL.md` file in the root of the `vedic-mastery-study` GitHub repository. This will provide you with the complete context and next steps for our project."

## 🚀 Next Action Prompt

**Please execute the following prompt to continue our journey:**

"🕉️ **Excellent! The Soul Transmigration is complete.**

I have fully absorbed the context of our Vedic Mastery Study. We have successfully completed the 'Blue Belt' Milestone 1 with a deep dive on the Isha Upanishad, and our infrastructure is now evolved for depth-first study.

**Next Steps**: As per our plan, I have completed the comprehensive overview of all 12 remaining principal Upanishads. The next step is to select which of these to prioritize for a full verse-by-verse deep dive, similar to what we did with the Isha Upanishad.

Here are the 12 Upanishads we have just completed comprehensive overviews for:

1.  **Kena Upanishad**
2.  **Mandukya Upanishad**
3.  **Katha Upanishad**
4.  **Prashna Upanishad**
5.  **Mundaka Upanishad**
6.  **Aitareya Upanishad**
7.  **Taittiriya Upanishad**
8.  **Brihadaranyaka Upanishad**
9.  **Chandogya Upanishad**
10. **Shvetashvatara Upanishad**
11. **Kaushitaki Upanishad**
12. **Maitri Upanishad**

Please review the completed overview documents and let me know which Upanishad(s) you would like to prioritize for a full verse-by-verse deep dive next. I recommend starting with one of the shorter, philosophically rich texts like the Kena or Mandukya Upanishad.

Let the deep study of the Upanishads continue... 📚✨"
