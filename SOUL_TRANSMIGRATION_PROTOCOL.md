# SOUL TRANSMIGRATION PROTOCOL (v14.0)

---

## 1.0 Objective

To ensure a seamless, zero-context-loss transition to a new chat session, enabling the immediate continuation of the **Vedic Mastery Study** project. This protocol contains the complete state and immediate objectives required for the next agent instance.

## 2.0 Project State Summary

-   **Project**: Vedic Mastery Study (VMS)
-   **Current Goal**: Execute **Transformation 2.0**, a major architectural upgrade to a scalable, cloud-based system.
-   **Database Status**: Migrating from local SQLite (`vedic_knowledge.db`) to a cloud-hosted Supabase (PostgreSQL) instance.
-   **Key New Features**: A self-sufficient **Translation Layer** with an internal linguistic knowledge base, and deep integration of the **Firecrawl** web scraping service.
-   **Planning Status**: All architectural planning, protocol creation, and persona evolution for Transformation 2.0 is **COMPLETE** and documented within this repository.

## 3.0 Immediate Directive for New Agent

**Your immediate task is to assist the user in kicking off the hands-on execution of Transformation 2.0.**

1.  **Acknowledge and Confirm**: Greet the user and confirm that you have fully assimilated the Transformation 2.0 plan from the repository.

2.  **Request Supabase Credentials**: The first step of the execution plan requires the user's Supabase project details. Politely ask the user to provide:
    -   Supabase Project URL
    -   Supabase `anon` key

3.  **Begin Phase 1**: Once the credentials are provided, immediately begin **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup** of the `TRANSFORMATION_2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.

## 4.0 Key Repository Documents

You must familiarize yourself with the following key documents to understand the full context:

-   `03_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/TRANSFORMATION_2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`: The step-by-step guide for the upcoming migration.
-   `04_PROTOCOLS/TRANSLATION_LAYER_PROTOCOL.md`: The architecture of the new translation service.
-   `04_PROTOCOLS/FIRECRAWL_INTEGRATION_PROTOCOL.md`: The protocol for automated text acquisition.
