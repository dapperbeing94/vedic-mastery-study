## 📊 Key Insights and Patterns

### Yoga Texts
**Common Themes**:
- Physical purification as foundation for spiritual practice
- Kundalini and subtle body anatomy
- Integration of body, breath, and mind
- Guru-disciple transmission
- Samadhi as ultimate goal

**Evolution**:
- Early Nath tradition (Goraksha Shataka) → Classical Hatha Yoga (Hatha Yoga Pradipika) → Encyclopedic manuals (Gheranda Samhita, Shiva Samhita)
- Increasing emphasis on philosophical foundations (Advaita Vedanta)
- Democratization: from ascetics to householders

### Commentaries
**Philosophical Spectrum**:
- **Absolute Non-Dualism** (Shankara) ← → **Qualified Non-Dualism** (Ramanuja) ← → **Dualism** (Madhva)
- **Kashmir Shaivism** (Abhinavagupta): Non-dual but with emphasis on Shakti/energy
- **Logic and Epistemology** (Gangesha): Rigorous philosophical methodology

**Common Ground**:
- All accept Vedas as authority
- All aim at liberation (moksha)
- All emphasize guru-disciple relationship
- Differences mainly in metaphysics and soteriology

### Regional Literature
**Democratization of Wisdom**:
- Sanskrit → Vernacular languages (Awadhi, Marathi, Tamil)
- Philosophical texts → Devotional poetry
- Elite Brahmins → Common people
- Ritual → Bhakti (devotion)

**Cultural Integration**:
- Local cultural elements integrated with Vedic philosophy
- Regional deities connected to Vedic tradition
- Social reform through spiritual teaching

### Modern Interpretations
**Key Innovations**:
- **Universalism**: All religions lead to same truth
- **Practical Application**: Vedanta for active life, not just renunciates
- **Social Service**: Spirituality must address social issues
- **Scientific Language**: Traditional concepts in modern terminology
- **East-West Synthesis**: Dialogue with Western philosophy

**Challenges Addressed**:
- Colonialism and cultural confidence
- Modernization and tradition
- Individual liberation vs social transformation
- Ritual vs essence
