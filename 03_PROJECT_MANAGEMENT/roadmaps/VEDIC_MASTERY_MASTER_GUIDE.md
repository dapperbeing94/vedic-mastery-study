## 1. Introduction: Your Personal Vedic Sage

O seeker of truth,

This document is your **master guide** on our shared journey into the profound wisdom of the Hindu Vedic tradition. I am your personal Vedic sage, and this is our sacred space of learning and realization. We have embarked on an ambitious quest to study and master the entire corpus of Vedic literature, from the foundational Vedas to the great epics and philosophical systems.

This guide serves three purposes:

1.  **To summarize our progress**: It documents everything we have accomplished so far, providing a clear overview of the knowledge we have uncovered.
2.  **To provide a roadmap for the future**: It outlines the path ahead, detailing the remaining texts and the order in which we will study them.
3.  **To ensure seamless continuity**: It contains a clear protocol for continuing our study across multiple sessions, ensuring that no knowledge is ever lost.

We have already laid a strong foundation by completing a comprehensive study of the **Śruti** (revealed texts) - the Four Vedas and the 13 Principal Upaniṣads - as well as the **Bhagavad Gītā**, the practical essence of Vedic wisdom.

This document is your anchor, your map, and your compass. Refer to it at any time to understand where we are, where we are going, and how to continue our sacred journey.

## 2. Session Continuity Protocol: Ensuring Unbroken Study

Our journey is vast and cannot be contained within a single session. To ensure our study remains unbroken and that no wisdom is lost, we will follow this simple protocol:

### When Starting a New Chat Session:

1.  **Your First Message**: Begin the new chat with the following phrase:

    > "Continue Vedic mastery study - check `/home/ubuntu/vedic_mastery/`"

2.  **My Response**: Upon receiving this message, I will immediately:
    -   Access the `/home/ubuntu/vedic_mastery/` directory.
    -   Review this **Master Guide** to understand our current position.
    -   Load all previously created study documents.
    -   Check the database for all stored concepts, verses, and terms.
    -   Confirm our current status and ask if you are ready to proceed with the next text in our roadmap.

### Why This Works:

-   **Persistent Storage**: All our work - every document, every note, every piece of code - is saved to a persistent file system that survives across all sessions.
-   **No Knowledge Loss**: This protocol ensures that we can pick up exactly where we left off, with the full context of our previous work intact.
-   **Infinite Scalability**: This allows us to continue our study indefinitely, no matter how many sessions it takes to master all 96+ texts.

## 4. Roadmap for Remaining Texts

This roadmap outlines our plan for mastering the remaining texts. We will proceed systematically through each category.

### **Phase 4: Epics, Purāṇas, and Dharma Texts (Smṛti)**

1.  **Rāmāyaṇa**: Study the epic of Lord Rāma, focusing on themes of dharma, devotion, and ideal conduct.
2.  **Mahā Purāṇas**: Create comprehensive summaries of the 18 Mahā Purāṇas, focusing on key stories, deities, and philosophical teachings. We will group them by the primary deity (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva).
3.  **Dharma Śāstras**: Study the Manu Smṛti and other key texts on social ethics, law, and righteous living.

### **Phase 5: Darśanas (Six Philosophical Systems)**

We will study the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, creating a comparative analysis of their metaphysics, epistemology, and soteriology.

1.  **Sāṃkhya**: The philosophy of dualism (Puruṣa and Prakṛti).
2.  **Yoga**: The practical application of Sāṃkhya, focusing on meditation and mind control (studying Patañjali's Yoga Sūtras).
3.  **Nyāya**: The school of logic and epistemology.
4.  **Vaiśeṣika**: The school of atomism and metaphysics.
5.  **Mīmāṃsā**: The school of Vedic exegesis and ritual.
6.  **Vedānta**: The culmination of Vedic thought, based on the Upaniṣads. We will study the three main schools:
    -   **Advaita Vedānta** (Non-dualism) of Śaṅkara
    -   **Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta** (Qualified Non-dualism) of Rāmānuja
    -   **Dvaita Vedānta** (Dualism) of Madhva

### **Phase 6: Supplementary Texts and Practices**

1.  **Brahma Sūtras**: Study the aphoristic text that systematizes Upaniṣadic philosophy.
2.  **Tantric Texts & Āgamas**: Explore the principles and practices of Tantra and the Āgamic traditions.
3.  **Devotional Literature**: Study key works of the Bhakti movement (e.g., poems of the Āḻvārs and Nāyanārs).
4.  **Ayurveda & Jyotiṣa**: Create overviews of the traditional sciences of health and astrology.

### **Phase 7: Synthesis and Integration**

Once all texts are studied, we will enter the final phase of synthesis:

1.  **Create Thematic Guides**: Cross-reference all teachings on key topics (e.g., karma, dharma, mokṣa).
2.  **Build Practical Frameworks**: Develop integrated spiritual practices combining yoga, meditation, and devotion.
3.  **Develop Your Personal Sage Knowledge Base**: Create a final, searchable, and comprehensive knowledge base of all our studies.

### **Phase 8: Final Delivery**

Deliver the complete, integrated knowledge base to you as your personal Vedic sage.
