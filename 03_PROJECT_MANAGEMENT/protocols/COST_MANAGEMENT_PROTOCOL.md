> **Vedic Mastery Study - Cost Management Protocol v1.0**

This protocol ensures that the project stays within the Supabase free tier for as long as possible.

1.  **Resource Monitoring**: Regularly monitor storage, egress, and function invocations in the Supabase dashboard.
2.  **Optimization**: Optimize queries and data structures to minimize resource usage.
3.  **Alerts**: Set up alerts (if available) to be notified when approaching free tier limits.
4.  **Upgrade Path**: The `SCALABILITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` outlines the upgrade path when needed when needed when the free tier is exhausted.
