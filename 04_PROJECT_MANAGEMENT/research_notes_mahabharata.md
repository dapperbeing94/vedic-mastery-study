### 2. Karṇa - The Tragic Hero
**Birth**: Son of Kuntī and Sūrya (sun god), born before marriage
**Abandonment**: Kuntī abandons him out of fear, found by charioteer Adhiratha
**Identity Crisis**: Raised as sūta (charioteer caste), faces discrimination
**Friendship**: Duryodhana makes him king of Aṅga, earns lifelong loyalty
**Curses**: 
- Paraśurāma curses him when discovers he's kṣatriya, not brāhmaṇa
- Earth curses him during practice
**Generosity**: Known as Dānavīra (charitable hero), gives away his divine armor and earrings to Indra
**Tragic Flaw**: Loyalty to wrong side, ego, anger at rejection
**Death**: Killed by Arjuna when his chariot wheel gets stuck, violating rules of fair combat
**Revelation**: Learns Kuntī is his mother just before war
**Significance**: Classic tragic hero - noble qualities undermined by circumstances and choices

### 3. Abhimanyu and the Chakravyūha (Droṇa Parva)
**Background**: Abhimanyu is son of Arjuna and Subhadrā, nephew of Kṛṣṇa
**The Chakravyūha**: Complex military formation like a labyrinth with multiple defensive walls
**Incomplete Knowledge**: Abhimanyu learned how to enter the formation in his mother's womb but not how to exit
**The Battle**: 
- Only Abhimanyu knows how to break into Chakravyūha when Arjuna is away
- Enters alone at age 16
- Fights valiantly against multiple Kaurava generals
- Surrounded and killed unfairly by multiple warriors
**Significance**: 
- Tragic death of young hero
- Shows Kaurava willingness to break dharma to win
- Demonstrates courage and incomplete knowledge being dangerous
- Deepens Pāṇḍava resolve for revenge

### 4. Bhīṣma's Vow (Adi Parva)
**Context**: Devavrata (later Bhīṣma) is son of King Śantanu and Gaṅgā
**The Vow**: 
- Śantanu falls in love with Satyavatī
- Her father demands her son be heir (not Devavrata)
- Devavrata takes terrible vow: lifelong celibacy (brahmacharya)
- Renounces throne for father's happiness
**Name**: Called Bhīṣma ("the terrible") for his terrible vow
**Boon**: Father grants him ichcha-mṛtyu (death at will)
**Significance**: 
- Shows extreme sacrifice for duty
- His vow binds him to serve Hastinapura throne regardless of who sits on it
- Creates moral dilemma - must fight for Kauravas despite knowing they're wrong

### 5. Draupadī's Birth and Swayamvara (Adi Parva)
**Birth**: Born from fire along with brother Dhṛṣṭadyumna
**Prophecy**: Destined to be cause of Kaurava destruction
**Swayamvara**: Contest to win her hand
- Must string difficult bow and hit target
- Arjuna (disguised as brāhmaṇa) wins
- Kuntī unknowingly says "share whatever you brought"
- Becomes wife of all five Pāṇḍavas
**Significance**: Polyandry explained through dharma, central to epic's events

### 6. Kṛṣṇa's Diplomacy (Udyoga Parva)
**Mission**: Kṛṣṇa goes to Hastinapura to prevent war
**Offer**: Pāṇḍavas willing to accept just five villages
**Duryodhana's Response**: "I will not give them land enough to drive a pin into"

**Result**: Diplomacy fails, war becomes inevitable
**Significance**: Shows Pāṇḍavas exhausted all peaceful options

### 7. Bhīṣma's Fall (Bhīṣma Parva)
**Problem**: Bhīṣma is invincible, has boon of choosing time of death
**Solution**: Śikhaṇḍī (born female, became male) whom Bhīṣma won't fight
**Strategy**: Arjuna uses Śikhaṇḍī as shield, shoots arrows at Bhīṣma
**Result**: Bhīṣma falls on bed of arrows, waits for Uttarāyaṇa to die
**Significance**: Shows necessity of unconventional tactics, Bhīṣma's honor even in defeat

### 8. Droṇa's Death (Droṇa Parva)
**Problem**: Droṇa is unstoppable warrior and teacher
**Strategy**: Yudhiṣṭhira (known for truth) tells half-truth: "Aśvatthāmā is dead" (elephant, not his son)
**Result**: Droṇa, believing son is dead, lays down weapons and is killed
**Significance**: Shows moral compromise even by righteous, necessity of adharma to defeat adharma

### 9. Karṇa's Death (Karṇa Parva)
**Context**: Karṇa becomes commander after Droṇa
**Curses Activate**: 
- Forgets Brahmāstra mantra (Paraśurāma's curse)
- Chariot wheel sinks into earth (Earth's curse)
**Unfair Death**: Kṛṣṇa reminds Arjuna of Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna kills Karṇa while he's trying to lift wheel
**Significance**: Tragic end of tragic hero, karma of past actions, moral ambiguity of war

### 10. Duryodhana's Death (Śalya Parva)
**Final Battle**: Mace fight between Bhīma and Duryodhana
**Unfair Blow**: Bhīma strikes Duryodhana's thighs (against rules)
**Kṛṣṇa's Signal**: Kṛṣṇa signals Bhīma to strike thighs (Duryodhana's weak spot)
**Duryodhana's Words**: Dies accusing Pāṇḍavas of adharma
**Significance**: Victory achieved through adharma, moral cost of war

### 11. Night Massacre (Sauptika Parva)

**Revenge**: Aśvatthāmā (Droṇa's son) enters Pāṇḍava camp at night
**Massacre**: Kills sleeping warriors including Draupadī's five sons (Upapandavas)
**Brahmaśirastra**: Aśvatthāmā releases ultimate weapon at Uttarā's womb (Arjuna's grandson)
**Kṛṣṇa's Intervention**: Protects unborn Parīkṣit
**Punishment**: Aśvatthāmā cursed to wander earth for 3000 years with festering wounds
**Significance**: Shows depths of revenge, violation of all dharma, protection of lineage

### 12. Destruction of Yādavas (Mausala Parva)
**Curse**: Gāndhārī curses Kṛṣṇa that his clan will destroy itself
**Fulfillment**: Yādavas get drunk, fight with maces (mausala), kill each other
**Kṛṣṇa's Death**: Shot in foot by hunter Jarā (reincarnation of Vāli from Rāmāyaṇa)
**Significance**: Even Kṛṣṇa subject to karma, cycle of violence ends

### 13. Final Journey (Mahāprasthānika Parva)
**Journey**: Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī begin final journey to Himalayas
**Falls**: One by one, each falls except Yudhiṣṭhira
- Draupadī falls (loved Arjuna more than others)
- Sahadeva falls (pride in wisdom)
- Nakula falls (pride in beauty)
- Arjuna falls (pride in archery)
- Bhīma falls (pride in strength)
**Yudhiṣṭhira Continues**: Only he continues, accompanied by dog
**Significance**: Shows flaws even in heroes, Yudhiṣṭhira's steadfastness

### 14. Final Test (Svargārohaṇa Parva)
**Heaven's Offer**: Indra offers to take Yudhiṣṭhira to heaven, but not the dog
**Yudhiṣṭhira's Refusal**: Refuses to abandon faithful companion
**Revelation**: Dog is Dharma (his father) in disguise, testing him
**Heaven's Surprise**: Finds Duryodhana in heaven, Pāṇḍavas in hell
**Final Test**: Yudhiṣṭhira refuses heaven without his brothers
**Ultimate Revelation**: All illusion (māyā), final test of loyalty
**Resolution**: All heroes reunited in heaven
**Significance**: Loyalty and dharma triumph, illusion of duality, ultimate reunion
